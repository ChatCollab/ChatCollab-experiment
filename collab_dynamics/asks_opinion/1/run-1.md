# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for opinion: evaluation, analysis, expression of feeling.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, I'm Isabelle, your developer. I look forward to working on our projects once the PRD is approved by the CEO. I'll ensure our code is modular, well-documented, and includes test cases. Feel free to share your thoughts and ideas as we move forward.

Hello team, as we kick off our new project, I would like to remind everyone of our process. We'll start with clarifying questions to the client, followed by the PM generating the PRD, and finally, the developer generating the code. I encourage everyone to share their thoughts and opinions throughout this process. Let's make this a successful project!

Hi everyone!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed description. To ensure I fully understand, the game should be text-based, interactive, and allow two players to take turns. The game should validate player inputs, display the updated board after each move, announce the result, and handle errors gracefully. It should also offer a restart option after the game concludes. Is that correct? Also, do you have any specific requirements for the conversational interface, such as the tone of the chatbot or any specific phrases you'd like it to use?

That is correct. No specific requirements.

# Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## 1. Overview
The product is a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game is targeted at users who enjoy simple, classic games and prefer a text-based interface.
## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Game Initialization
At the start of the game, an empty 3x3 grid is displayed to represent the game board. The first player is assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player is assigned the 'O' symbol.
### 2.2 Player Input
Players are prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The game validates the input to ensure it is within the range of the board and the chosen cell is not already occupied.
### 2.3 Game Progress
After each move, the game displays the updated board. The game checks for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game announces the result and ends the game.
### 2.4 Error Handling
The game implements error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
### 2.5 Game Restart
After the game concludes, the game asks if the players want to play again. If they do, the game resets the board and starts a new game. If not, the game bids farewell.
## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
The game should be interactive, user-friendly, and engaging. It should handle unexpected inputs gracefully and ensure a smooth overall gaming experience. The code should be in Java, modular, well-documented, and include test cases.
## 4. User Interface
The game uses a text-based interface. Prompts and responses are displayed in the console. The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid with numbered rows and columns for easy input. Player symbols ('X' or 'O') are displayed in the corresponding cells based on their moves.
## 5. Constraints
The game should be developed in Java and the code should compile without errors. The game should not call a method that is not declared, there should be no method with an empty body, and the return types should be correct.
## 6. Future Enhancements
In future versions, we could consider adding features like player profiles, a score tracking system, and an AI opponent for single-player mode. We could also consider adding a graphical user interface for a more visually appealing experience.
