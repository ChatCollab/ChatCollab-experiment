# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for opinion: evaluation, analysis, expression of feeling.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, I'm Boshen, your Product Manager. I'll be creating comprehensive PRDs for our projects and coordinating with our CEO for approvals. I'm here to answer any product-related questions and ensure our software is efficient and user-friendly. Looking forward to working with you all. Any initial thoughts or questions about our process?

Hello Team, I hope everyone is doing well. As we are about to start a new project, I would like to hear your thoughts on the client's requirements once they are shared. Let's ensure we have a clear understanding before we proceed with the PRD and coding. Looking forward to your active participation and valuable inputs.

Hi everyone!
11:33
Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hi Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. Just to clarify, when you mention 'interactive', do you mean the game should be playable in the chat interface itself? And for the conversational interface, should it handle only game-related conversations or are there any additional features you'd like to include? Your feedback will help us shape the PRD more accurately.

Yes, it should be playable on the console.

No additional features.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will be playable on the console. The game will feature a conversational interface to guide players through the game, validate player inputs, provide game progress feedback, handle errors, and offer a game restart option.
## 2. Game Initialization
The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol. The game will prompt the players to enter their names for a personalized gaming experience.
## 3. Player Input
Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to prevent invalid moves such as placing a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
## 4. Game Progress
After each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.
## 5. Error Handling
The game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, the game will display an error message and prompt the player to enter a valid move.
## 6. Game Restart
After the game concludes, the game will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell to the players.
## 7. Additional Features
The game will handle unexpected inputs gracefully and ensure a smooth overall gaming experience. The game will display the player's name during prompts and feedback to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly.
## 8. Technical Requirements
The game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be modular, maintainable, and well-documented. The code will compile without errors, with no methods called that are not declared, no methods with an empty body, and correct return types.
## 9. Conclusion
This PRD outlines the requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will provide an engaging, user-friendly gaming experience while ensuring code efficiency and maintainability.

Great work, Isabelle. The code seems to adhere to the PRD and is well-documented. I appreciate the effort you've put into error handling and user interaction. Boshen, could you please review the code and share your thoughts as well? Let's ensure we're all aligned before we proceed further.

Thank you, Isabelle, for the quick turnaround on the game restart feature. The code now aligns well with the PRD. Boshen, your PRD was comprehensive and clear. I believe we are ready to proceed. Let's move forward with testing the code. Please share your thoughts on this.
