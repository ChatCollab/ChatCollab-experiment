Looking forward to working with you all.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, I'm Isabelle, your developer. I'll be writing the code for our projects once the PRD is approved. Feel free to reach out for any development-related queries. Looking forward to working with you all!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm here to ensure we deliver high-quality software to our clients. Once we receive the client's requirements, I'll approve them and then Boshen, you can start on the PRD. Once I approve the PRD, our developers can start coding. Remember, thorough documentation is key. Let's work together to make this project a success.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly.

Once I approve the PRD, our developers can start coding. Remember, thorough documentation is key. Let's work together to make this project a success.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBenjamin (Client): How is the progress?\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, we are currently in the process of designing the product based on your requirements.

Once it's ready, I'll share it for your approval before we proceed to the development phase.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File 1: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to interactively play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\n\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.\n\n## 3. Player Input\n\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\n\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8. Technical Requirements\n\nThe game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be written in a way that it compiles without errors. This includes ensuring that all methods are declared before they are called, no method has an empty body, and the return types are correct.\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Boshen (Product Manager) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are a professional product manager.

Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to interactively play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\n\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.\n\n## 3. Player Input\n\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\n\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8. Technical Requirements\n\nThe game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be written in a way that it compiles without errors. This includes ensuring that all methods are declared before they are called, no method has an empty body, and the return types are correct.\n\nPeter (CEO): Thanks for the comprehensive PRD, Boshen.

If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8. Technical Requirements\n\nThe game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be written in a way that it compiles without errors. This includes ensuring that all methods are declared before they are called, no method has an empty body, and the return types are correct.\n\nPeter (CEO): Thanks for the comprehensive PRD, Boshen.

Feel free to reach out for any development-related queries. Looking forward to working with you all!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm here to ensure we deliver high-quality software to our clients. Once we receive the client's requirements, I'll approve them and then Boshen, you can start on the PRD. Once I approve the PRD, our developers can start coding. Remember, thorough documentation is key. Let's work together to make this project a success.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBenjamin (Client): How is the progress?\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, we are currently in the process of designing the product based on your requirements. Once the design is approved by our CEO, we will move on to the development phase. I'll keep you updated on our progress. Thank you for your patience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, we have received your requirements and are currently in the process of creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Once the PRD is approved, our developer, Isabelle, will start coding the game. We will keep you updated on the progress. Thank you for your patience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Understood, Peter. I'm starting to work on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I'll ensure it covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin, including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Once it's ready, I'll share it for your approval before we proceed to the development phase.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File 1: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to interactively play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\n\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.\n\n## 3. Player Input\n\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\n\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8. Technical Requirements\n\nThe game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be written in a way that it compiles without errors. This includes ensuring that all methods are declared before they are called, no method has an empty body, and the return types are correct.\n\nPeter (CEO): Thanks for the comprehensive PRD, Boshen. It covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin. I approve it. Isabelle, you can now start coding the game. Please ensure that the code is well-documented and error-free. Let's keep the client updated on our progress.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File 1: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer;

Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBenjamin (Client): How is the progress?\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, we are currently in the process of designing the product based on your requirements. Once the design is approved by our CEO, we will move on to the development phase. I'll keep you updated on our progress. Thank you for your patience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, we have received your requirements and are currently in the process of creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Once the PRD is approved, our developer, Isabelle, will start coding the game. We will keep you updated on the progress. Thank you for your patience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Understood, Peter. I'm starting to work on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I'll ensure it covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin, including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Once it's ready, I'll share it for your approval before we proceed to the development phase.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File 1: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to interactively play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\n\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.\n\n## 3. Player Input\n\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\n\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8. Technical Requirements\n\nThe game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be written in a way that it compiles without errors. This includes ensuring that all methods are declared before they are called, no method has an empty body, and the return types are correct.\n\nPeter (CEO): Thanks for the comprehensive PRD, Boshen. It covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin. I approve it. Isabelle, you can now start coding the game. Please ensure that the code is well-documented and error-free. Let's keep the client updated on our progress.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File 1: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer;

Once I approve the PRD, our developers can start coding. Remember, thorough documentation is key. Let's work together to make this project a success.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBenjamin (Client): How is the progress?\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, we are currently in the process of designing the product based on your requirements.

Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to interactively play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\n\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.\n\n## 3. Player Input\n\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\n\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8.

Looking forward to working with you all.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, I'm Isabelle, your developer. I'll be writing the code for our projects once the PRD is approved. Feel free to reach out for any development-related queries. Looking forward to working with you all!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm here to ensure we deliver high-quality software to our clients. Once we receive the client's requirements, I'll approve them and then Boshen, you can start on the PRD. Once I approve the PRD, our developers can start coding. Remember, thorough documentation is key. Let's work together to make this project a success.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBenjamin (Client): How is the progress?\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, we are currently in the process of designing the product based on your requirements. Once the design is approved by our CEO, we will move on to the development phase. I'll keep you updated on our progress. Thank you for your patience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, we have received your requirements and are currently in the process of creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD).

I'm starting to work on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I'll ensure it covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin, including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Once it's ready, I'll share it for your approval before we proceed to the development phase.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File 1: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to interactively play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\n\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.\n\n## 3. Player Input\n\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\n\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8. Technical Requirements\n\nThe game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be written in a way that it compiles without errors. This includes ensuring that all methods are declared before they are called, no method has an empty body, and the return types are correct.\n\nPeter (CEO): Thanks for the comprehensive PRD, Boshen. It covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin. I approve it. Isabelle, you can now start coding the game. Please ensure that the code is well-documented and error-free.

Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8. Technical Requirements\n\nThe game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be written in a way that it compiles without errors. This includes ensuring that all methods are declared before they are called, no method has an empty body, and the return types are correct.\n\nPeter (CEO): Thanks for the comprehensive PRD, Boshen. It covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin. I approve it. Isabelle, you can now start coding the game. Please ensure that the code is well-documented and error-free.

I'm here to help design efficient and usable products. I'll be creating comprehensive PRDs for our projects, once approved by the CEO. I'm also available to answer any product-related questions. Looking forward to working with you all.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, I'm Isabelle, your developer. I'll be writing the code for our projects once the PRD is approved. Feel free to reach out for any development-related queries. Looking forward to working with you all!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm here to ensure we deliver high-quality software to our clients. Once we receive the client's requirements, I'll approve them and then Boshen, you can start on the PRD. Once I approve the PRD, our developers can start coding. Remember, thorough documentation is key. Let's work together to make this project a success.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBenjamin (Client): How is the progress?\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, we are currently in the process of designing the product based on your requirements. Once the design is approved by our CEO, we will move on to the development phase. I'll keep you updated on our progress. Thank you for your patience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, we have received your requirements and are currently in the process of creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Once the PRD is approved, our developer, Isabelle, will start coding the game. We will keep you updated on the progress. Thank you for your patience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Understood, Peter. I'm starting to work on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I'll ensure it covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin, including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Once it's ready, I'll share it for your approval before we proceed to the development phase.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File 1: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to interactively play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\n\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.\n\n## 3. Player Input\n\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\n\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8.

        "query": "<Chat History>\nThe following is the chat history on Slack:\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello team, this is Boshen, your Product Manager. I'm here to help design efficient and usable products. I'll be creating comprehensive PRDs for our projects, once approved by the CEO. I'm also available to answer any product-related questions. Looking forward to working with you all.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, I'm Isabelle, your developer. I'll be writing the code for our projects once the PRD is approved. Feel free to reach out for any development-related queries. Looking forward to working with you all!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm here to ensure we deliver high-quality software to our clients. Once we receive the client's requirements, I'll approve them and then Boshen, you can start on the PRD. Once I approve the PRD, our developers can start coding. Remember, thorough documentation is key. Let's work together to make this project a success.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBenjamin (Client): How is the progress?\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, we are currently in the process of designing the product based on your requirements. Once the design is approved by our CEO, we will move on to the development phase. I'll keep you updated on our progress. Thank you for your patience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, we have received your requirements and are currently in the process of creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Once the PRD is approved, our developer, Isabelle, will start coding the game. We will keep you updated on the progress. Thank you for your patience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Understood, Peter. I'm starting to work on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I'll ensure it covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin, including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Once it's ready, I'll share it for your approval before we proceed to the development phase.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File 1: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to interactively play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\n\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.\n\n## 3. Player Input\n\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\n\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\n\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Additional Features\n\nTo make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:\n\n- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.\n- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.\n- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.\n\n## 8. Technical Requirements\n\nThe game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be written in a way that it compiles without errors. This includes ensuring that all methods are declared before they are called, no method has an empty body, and the return types are correct.\n\nPeter (CEO): Thanks for the comprehensive PRD, Boshen. It covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin. I approve it. Isabelle, you can now start coding the game. Please ensure that the code is well-documented and error-free. Let's keep the client updated on our progress.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File 1: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer;
