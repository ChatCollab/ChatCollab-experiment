# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for orientation: information, repetition, confirmation.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm here to ensure we deliver high-quality software to our clients. Once we receive the client's requirements, I'll approve them and then Boshen, you can start on the PRD. Once I approve the PRD, our developers can start coding. Remember, thorough documentation is key. Let's work together to make this project a success.

Hi everyone!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, we have received your requirements and are currently in the process of creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Once the PRD is approved, our developer, Isabelle, will start coding the game. We will keep you updated on the progress. Thank you for your patience.

Boshen (Product Manager)

Understood, Peter. I'm starting to work on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I'll ensure it covers all the aspects mentioned by Benjamin, including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Once it's ready, I'll share it for your approval before we proceed to the development phase.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to interactively play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid.
## 2. Game Initialization
The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.
## 3. Player Input
Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.
## 4. Game Progress
After each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.
## 5. Error Handling
The game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. This includes attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position. The game will prompt the player to enter a valid move in such cases.
## 6. Game Restart
After the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.
## 7. Additional Features
To make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will include the following features:
- Displaying the player's name: The game will prompt the players to enter their names at the start of the game and will use these names during the game.
- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully: If a player enters an unexpected input, the game will display a friendly error message and prompt the player to enter a valid input.
- Smooth gaming experience: The game will ensure a smooth gaming experience by providing clear instructions, displaying the game progress clearly, and providing feedback on the game's outcome.
## 8. Technical Requirements
The game will be developed in the Java programming language. The code will be written in a way that it compiles without errors. This includes ensuring that all methods are declared before they are called, no method has an empty body, and the return types are correct.

Great work, Isabelle! The code and test cases look comprehensive. Let's proceed with testing and debugging. Once that's done, we'll present the final product to Benjamin. Keep up the good work!
