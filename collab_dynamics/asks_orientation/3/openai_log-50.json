To ensure we're on the same page, I have a few clarifying questions. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, should the players be able to choose their own symbols or will they always be 'X' and 'O'? Also, when you mention 'interactive', do you mean the game should be playable in the console or should it have a graphical user interface? Lastly, should the game support a single player mode against an AI? Your answers will help us shape the PRD accurately. Thanks!\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, and hi Benjamin. Thanks for sharing the requirements. I have a few clarifications to make sure I understand everything correctly. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, when you mention handling unexpected inputs, do you want the game to simply display an error message and ask for a new input, or do you want it to provide suggestions for valid inputs? Also, should the players' names be displayed during the game? Lastly, for the game restart, should it be automatic or only upon players' request? Looking forward to your responses.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Always X and O. It should be playable in console. No AI needed.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Thank you for the clarifications, Benjamin. I will now start working on the PRD based on these requirements. Once the PRD is ready, I'll share it with the team for review. We'll ensure to create an engaging and user-friendly text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's create something great together!\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File: PRD_TicTacToeGame.docx&gt;\n\n1. Introduction\n   - Product Name: Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n   - Purpose: To create an interactive, console-based game that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe.\n   - Programming Language: Java\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   - The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   - Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   - Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   - The input will be validated to ensure it is a valid move (i.e., the specified position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied).\n\n4. Game Progress\n   - After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed.\n   - The game will check for a win or a tie after each move.\n   - If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   - If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message will be displayed and the player will be prompted to input a new move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   - After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again.\n   - If they choose to play again, the board will be reset and a new game will start.\n   - If they choose not to play again, the game will bid farewell and end.\n\n7. Additional Requirements\n   - The game will be playable in the console.\n   - No AI is needed; the game will be strictly two-player.\n   - The players' symbols will always be 'X' and 'O'.\n\n8. Conclusion\n   - The goal is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and efficient text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that adheres to the client's requirements and provides a smooth gaming experience.\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Isabelle (Developer) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are a professional developer.

I'll be reviewing the project details shortly and will provide the necessary approvals. Let's ensure we have a clear understanding of the client's requirements before we proceed. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions you may have. Let's aim for a well-documented and efficient codebase. Looking forward to our collaboration.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again.

Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we're on the same page, I have a few clarifying questions. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, should the players be able to choose their own symbols or will they always be 'X' and 'O'? Also, when you mention 'interactive', do you mean the game should be playable in the console or should it have a graphical user interface? Lastly, should the game support a single player mode against an AI? Your answers will help us shape the PRD accurately. Thanks!\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, and hi Benjamin. Thanks for sharing the requirements. I have a few clarifications to make sure I understand everything correctly. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, when you mention handling unexpected inputs, do you want the game to simply display an error message and ask for a new input, or do you want it to provide suggestions for valid inputs? Also, should the players' names be displayed during the game? Lastly, for the game restart, should it be automatic or only upon players' request? Looking forward to your responses.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Always X and O. It should be playable in console. No AI needed.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Thank you for the clarifications, Benjamin. I will now start working on the PRD based on these requirements. Once the PRD is ready, I'll share it with the team for review. We'll ensure to create an engaging and user-friendly text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's create something great together!\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File: PRD_TicTacToeGame.docx&gt;\n\n1. Introduction\n   - Product Name: Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n   - Purpose: To create an interactive, console-based game that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe.\n   - Programming Language: Java\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   - The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   - Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   - Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   - The input will be validated to ensure it is a valid move (i.e., the specified position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied).\n\n4. Game Progress\n   - After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed.\n   - The game will check for a win or a tie after each move.\n   - If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   - If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message will be displayed and the player will be prompted to input a new move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   - After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again.\n   - If they choose to play again, the board will be reset and a new game will start.\n   - If they choose not to play again, the game will bid farewell and end.\n\n7. Additional Requirements\n   - The game will be playable in the console.\n   - No AI is needed; the game will be strictly two-player.\n   - The players' symbols will always be 'X' and 'O'.\n\n8. Conclusion\n   - The goal is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and efficient text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that adheres to the client's requirements and provides a smooth gaming experience.\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Isabelle (Developer) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are a professional developer. Your role is to build modular and easy to read and maintain code. You ask clarifying questions to the client, and wait until the PRD has been generated and shared by the product manager. Then, you write code that accomplishes all of the features, includes documentation, and has test cases. You will write code to Slack..\n\n</Persona>\n\n<Background>In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.\n\nUse the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for orientation: information, repetition, confirmation.</Background><Internal Thoughts>Reason: As the developer, my next action should be to start working on the code now that the PRD has been shared by the product manager. The PRD is clear and I don't have any further questions at this point. Therefore, I should start creating the code for the text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game as per the requirements outlined in the PRD. \n\nOption 2: Generate a file you promised to create or are responsible for creating.</Internal Thoughts>\n\n<Instructions>You are Isabelle (Developer). If there is a file generation you have promised to complete which you have not done yet, but should do now, add the action title and the prompt to the JSON below. Be aware, you can ONLY create and send files, no other actions are possible. The prompt field is for constructing a direct prompt for a LLM to generate file(s) relevant to the action. In the prompt, include ALL context relevant from the provided Slack conversation.\n\n\nProvide your response structured as follows:\n{\"title\": \"This is the title of the next relevant file generation action I should take as Isabelle (Developer). If there is no action for YOUR SPECIFIC AGENT to take NOW (especially if you are waiting for approval or another agent's deliverable), leave this blank.\",\"prompt\":\"Constructed prompt, including all the context required for the file generation task (such as a PRD or code files). If there is no action to take, leave this blank.\"}\n</Instructions>",

Thanks for sharing the requirements. I have a few clarifications to make sure I understand everything correctly. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, when you mention handling unexpected inputs, do you want the game to simply display an error message and ask for a new input, or do you want it to provide suggestions for valid inputs? Also, should the players' names be displayed during the game? Lastly, for the game restart, should it be automatic or only upon players' request? Looking forward to your responses.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Always X and O. It should be playable in console. No AI needed.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Thank you for the clarifications, Benjamin. I will now start working on the PRD based on these requirements. Once the PRD is ready, I'll share it with the team for review. We'll ensure to create an engaging and user-friendly text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's create something great together!\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File: PRD_TicTacToeGame.docx&gt;\n\n1. Introduction\n   - Product Name: Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n   - Purpose: To create an interactive, console-based game that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe.\n   - Programming Language: Java\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   - The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   - Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   - Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   - The input will be validated to ensure it is a valid move (i.e., the specified position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied).\n\n4. Game Progress\n   - After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed.\n   - The game will check for a win or a tie after each move.\n   - If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   - If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message will be displayed and the player will be prompted to input a new move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   - After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again.\n   - If they choose to play again, the board will be reset and a new game will start.\n   - If they choose not to play again, the game will bid farewell and end.\n\n7. Additional Requirements\n   - The game will be playable in the console.\n   - No AI is needed; the game will be strictly two-player.\n   - The players' symbols will always be 'X' and 'O'.\n\n8. Conclusion\n   - The goal is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and efficient text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that adheres to the client's requirements and provides a smooth gaming experience.\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Isabelle (Developer) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are a professional developer. Your role is to build modular and easy to read and maintain code. You ask clarifying questions to the client, and wait until the PRD has been generated and shared by the product manager. Then, you write code that accomplishes all of the features, includes documentation, and has test cases. You will write code to Slack..\n\n</Persona>\n\n\n\n<Instructions>Generate Tic-Tac-Toe Game Code\n\nAs Isabelle, the developer, you need to create the Java code for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and playable in the console. It should allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes. The code should be well-documented with inline comments and include test cases. Consider the following aspects in your code:\n\n1. Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\n2. Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\n3. Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\n4. Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\n5. Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\n\nRemember, the code should be modular, easy to read, and maintain. It should compile without errors, meaning you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body, and the return types are correct.\n\nOutput ONLY the file(s) and their names.

Introduction\n   - Product Name: Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n   - Purpose: To create an interactive, console-based game that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe.\n   - Programming Language: Java\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   - The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   - Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   - Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   - The input will be validated to ensure it is a valid move (i.e., the specified position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied).\n\n4. Game Progress\n   - After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed.\n   - The game will check for a win or a tie after each move.\n   - If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   - If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message will be displayed and the player will be prompted to input a new move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   - After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again.\n   - If they choose to play again, the board will be reset and a new game will start.\n   - If they choose not to play again, the game will bid farewell and end.\n\n7. Additional Requirements\n   - The game will be playable in the console.\n   - No AI is needed; the game will be strictly two-player.\n   - The players' symbols will always be 'X' and 'O'.\n\n8. Conclusion\n   - The goal is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and efficient text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that adheres to the client's requirements and provides a smooth gaming experience.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer; \n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"\\n-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the board is full.\n    boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    // Check for a win.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.\n    private boolean checkDiagonalsForWin() {\n        return ((checkRowCol(board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) == true) || checkRowCol(board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]) == true);\n    }\n\n    // Check to see if all three values are the same and not empty.\n    private boolean checkRowCol(char c1, char c2, char c3) {\n        return ((c1 != '-') &amp;&amp; (c1 == c2) &amp;&amp; (c2 == c3));\n    }\n\n    // Change player marks back and forth.\n    public void changePlayer() {\n        if (currentPlayer == 'X') {\n            currentPlayer = 'O';\n        } else {\n            currentPlayer = 'X';\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Places a mark at the cell specified by row and col with the mark of the current player.\n    public boolean placeMark(int row, int col) {\n        if ((row &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (row &lt; 3)) {\n            if ((col &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (col &lt; 3)) {\n                if (board[row][col] == '-') {\n                    board[row][col] = currentPlayer;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(<http://System.in|System.in>);\n        TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();\n        game.initializeBoard();\n        do {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            int row;\n            int col;\n            do {\n                System.out.println(\"Player \" + game.currentPlayer + \", enter an empty row and column to place your mark!\");\n                row = scan.nextInt()-1;\n                col = scan.nextInt()-1;\n            }\n            while (!game.placeMark(row, col));\n            game.changePlayer();\n        }\n        while(!game.checkForWin() &amp;&amp; !game.isBoardFull());\n        if (game.isBoardFull() &amp;&amp; !game.checkForWin()) {\n            System.out.println(\"The game was a tie!\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            game.changePlayer();\n\nIsabelle (Developer):             System.out.println(Character.toUpperCase(game.currentPlayer) + \" Wins!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n&lt;/File&gt;\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Isabelle (Developer) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are a professional developer.

Looking forward to your responses.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Always X and O. It should be playable in console. No AI needed.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Thank you for the clarifications, Benjamin. I will now start working on the PRD based on these requirements. Once the PRD is ready, I'll share it with the team for review. We'll ensure to create an engaging and user-friendly text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's create something great together!\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File: PRD_TicTacToeGame.docx&gt;\n\n1. Introduction\n   - Product Name: Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n   - Purpose: To create an interactive, console-based game that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe.\n   - Programming Language: Java\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   - The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   - Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   - Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   - The input will be validated to ensure it is a valid move (i.e., the specified position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied).\n\n4. Game Progress\n   - After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed.\n   - The game will check for a win or a tie after each move.\n   - If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   - If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message will be displayed and the player will be prompted to input a new move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   - After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again.\n   - If they choose to play again, the board will be reset and a new game will start.\n   - If they choose not to play again, the game will bid farewell and end.\n\n7. Additional Requirements\n   - The game will be playable in the console.\n   - No AI is needed; the game will be strictly two-player.\n   - The players' symbols will always be 'X' and 'O'.\n\n8. Conclusion\n   - The goal is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and efficient text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that adheres to the client's requirements and provides a smooth gaming experience.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer; \n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"\\n-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the board is full.\n    boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    // Check for a win.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.\n    private boolean checkDiagonalsForWin() {\n        return ((checkRowCol(board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) == true) || checkRowCol(board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]) == true);\n    }\n\n    // Check to see if all three values are the same and not empty.\n    private boolean checkRowCol(char c1, char c2, char c3) {\n        return ((c1 != '-') &amp;&amp; (c1 == c2) &amp;&amp; (c2 == c3));\n    }\n\n    // Change player marks back and forth.\n    public void changePlayer() {\n        if (currentPlayer == 'X') {\n            currentPlayer = 'O';\n        } else {\n            currentPlayer = 'X';\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Places a mark at the cell specified by row and col with the mark of the current player.\n    public boolean placeMark(int row, int col) {\n        if ((row &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (row &lt; 3)) {\n            if ((col &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (col &lt; 3)) {\n                if (board[row][col] == '-') {\n                    board[row][col] = currentPlayer;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(<http://System.in|System.in>);\n        TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();\n        game.initializeBoard();\n        do {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            int row;\n            int col;\n            do {\n                System.out.println(\"Player \" + game.currentPlayer + \", enter an empty row and column to place your mark!\");\n                row = scan.nextInt()-1;\n                col = scan.nextInt()-1;\n            }\n            while (!game.placeMark(row, col));\n            game.changePlayer();\n        }\n        while(!game.checkForWin() &amp;&amp; !game.isBoardFull());\n        if (game.isBoardFull() &amp;&amp; !game.checkForWin()) {\n            System.out.println(\"The game was a tie!\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            game.changePlayer();\n\nIsabelle (Developer):             System.out.println(Character.toUpperCase(game.currentPlayer) + \" Wins!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n&lt;/File&gt;\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Peter (CEO) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are the CEO of a development firm that creates software for a client, who will provide their requirements, and can answer clarifying questions.

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions you may have. Let's aim for a well-documented and efficient codebase. Looking forward to our collaboration.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we're on the same page, I have a few clarifying questions. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, should the players be able to choose their own symbols or will they always be 'X' and 'O'? Also, when you mention 'interactive', do you mean the game should be playable in the console or should it have a graphical user interface? Lastly, should the game support a single player mode against an AI? Your answers will help us shape the PRD accurately. Thanks!\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, and hi Benjamin. Thanks for sharing the requirements. I have a few clarifications to make sure I understand everything correctly. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, when you mention handling unexpected inputs, do you want the game to simply display an error message and ask for a new input, or do you want it to provide suggestions for valid inputs? Also, should the players' names be displayed during the game? Lastly, for the game restart, should it be automatic or only upon players' request?

Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we're on the same page, I have a few clarifying questions. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, should the players be able to choose their own symbols or will they always be 'X' and 'O'? Also, when you mention 'interactive', do you mean the game should be playable in the console or should it have a graphical user interface? Lastly, should the game support a single player mode against an AI? Your answers will help us shape the PRD accurately. Thanks!\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, and hi Benjamin. Thanks for sharing the requirements. I have a few clarifications to make sure I understand everything correctly. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, when you mention handling unexpected inputs, do you want the game to simply display an error message and ask for a new input, or do you want it to provide suggestions for valid inputs? Also, should the players' names be displayed during the game? Lastly, for the game restart, should it be automatic or only upon players' request? Looking forward to your responses.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Always X and O. It should be playable in console. No AI needed.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Thank you for the clarifications, Benjamin. I will now start working on the PRD based on these requirements. Once the PRD is ready, I'll share it with the team for review. We'll ensure to create an engaging and user-friendly text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's create something great together!\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File: PRD_TicTacToeGame.docx&gt;\n\n1. Introduction\n   - Product Name: Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n   - Purpose: To create an interactive, console-based game that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe.\n   - Programming Language: Java\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   - The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   - Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   - Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   - The input will be validated to ensure it is a valid move (i.e., the specified position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied).\n\n4. Game Progress\n   - After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed.\n   - The game will check for a win or a tie after each move.\n   - If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   - If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message will be displayed and the player will be prompted to input a new move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   - After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again.\n   - If they choose to play again, the board will be reset and a new game will start.\n   - If they choose not to play again, the game will bid farewell and end.\n\n7. Additional Requirements\n   - The game will be playable in the console.\n   - No AI is needed; the game will be strictly two-player.\n   - The players' symbols will always be 'X' and 'O'.\n\n8. Conclusion\n   - The goal is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and efficient text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that adheres to the client's requirements and provides a smooth gaming experience.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer; \n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"\\n-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the board is full.\n    boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    // Check for a win.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.\n    private boolean checkDiagonalsForWin() {\n        return ((checkRowCol(board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) == true) || checkRowCol(board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]) == true);\n    }\n\n    // Check to see if all three values are the same and not empty.\n    private boolean checkRowCol(char c1, char c2, char c3) {\n        return ((c1 != '-') &amp;&amp; (c1 == c2) &amp;&amp; (c2 == c3));\n    }\n\n    // Change player marks back and forth.\n    public void changePlayer() {\n        if (currentPlayer == 'X') {\n            currentPlayer = 'O';\n        } else {\n            currentPlayer = 'X';\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Places a mark at the cell specified by row and col with the mark of the current player.\n    public boolean placeMark(int row, int col) {\n        if ((row &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (row &lt; 3)) {\n            if ((col &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (col &lt; 3)) {\n                if (board[row][col] == '-') {\n                    board[row][col] = currentPlayer;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(<http://System.in|System.in>);\n        TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();\n        game.initializeBoard();\n        do {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            int row;\n            int col;\n            do {\n                System.out.println(\"Player \" + game.currentPlayer + \", enter an empty row and column to place your mark!\");\n                row = scan.nextInt()-1;\n                col = scan.nextInt()-1;\n            }\n            while (!game.placeMark(row, col));\n            game.changePlayer();\n        }\n        while(!game.checkForWin() &amp;&amp; !game.isBoardFull());\n        if (game.isBoardFull() &amp;&amp; !game.checkForWin()) {\n            System.out.println(\"The game was a tie!\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            game.changePlayer();\n\nIsabelle (Developer):             System.out.println(Character.toUpperCase(game.currentPlayer) + \" Wins!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n&lt;/File&gt;\n\nPeter (CEO): Great work, Isabelle.

I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Once we receive approval from the CEO, I'll be sharing the PRD for review. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification on anything. Let's create some amazing products together!\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello everyone, I'm Isabelle, your developer for this project. I'll be writing the code once we have the approved PRD. Looking forward to working with you all!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter. I appreciate your readiness, Boshen. I'll be reviewing the project details shortly and will provide the necessary approvals. Let's ensure we have a clear understanding of the client's requirements before we proceed. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions you may have. Let's aim for a well-documented and efficient codebase. Looking forward to our collaboration.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we're on the same page, I have a few clarifying questions. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, should the players be able to choose their own symbols or will they always be 'X' and 'O'? Also, when you mention 'interactive', do you mean the game should be playable in the console or should it have a graphical user interface? Lastly, should the game support a single player mode against an AI? Your answers will help us shape the PRD accurately. Thanks!\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, and hi Benjamin. Thanks for sharing the requirements. I have a few clarifications to make sure I understand everything correctly. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, when you mention handling unexpected inputs, do you want the game to simply display an error message and ask for a new input, or do you want it to provide suggestions for valid inputs? Also, should the players' names be displayed during the game? Lastly, for the game restart, should it be automatic or only upon players' request? Looking forward to your responses.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Always X and O. It should be playable in console. No AI needed.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Thank you for the clarifications, Benjamin. I will now start working on the PRD based on these requirements. Once the PRD is ready, I'll share it with the team for review. We'll ensure to create an engaging and user-friendly text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's create something great together!\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File: PRD_TicTacToeGame.docx&gt;\n\n1. Introduction\n   - Product Name: Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n   - Purpose: To create an interactive, console-based game that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe.\n   - Programming Language: Java\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   - The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   - Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   - Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   - The input will be validated to ensure it is a valid move (i.e., the specified position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied).\n\n4. Game Progress\n   - After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed.\n   - The game will check for a win or a tie after each move.\n   - If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   - If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message will be displayed and the player will be prompted to input a new move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   - After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again.\n   - If they choose to play again, the board will be reset and a new game will start.\n   - If they choose not to play again, the game will bid farewell and end.\n\n7. Additional Requirements\n   - The game will be playable in the console.\n   - No AI is needed; the game will be strictly two-player.\n   - The players' symbols will always be 'X' and 'O'.\n\n8. Conclusion\n   - The goal is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and efficient text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that adheres to the client's requirements and provides a smooth gaming experience.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer; \n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"\\n-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the board is full.\n    boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    // Check for a win.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.\n    private boolean checkDiagonalsForWin() {\n        return ((checkRowCol(board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) == true) || checkRowCol(board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]) == true);\n    }\n\n    // Check to see if all three values are the same and not empty.\n    private boolean checkRowCol(char c1, char c2, char c3) {\n        return ((c1 != '-') &amp;&amp; (c1 == c2) &amp;&amp; (c2 == c3));\n    }\n\n    // Change player marks back and forth.\n    public void changePlayer() {\n        if (currentPlayer == 'X') {\n            currentPlayer = 'O';\n        } else {\n            currentPlayer = 'X';\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Places a mark at the cell specified by row and col with the mark of the current player.\n    public boolean placeMark(int row, int col) {\n        if ((row &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (row &lt; 3)) {\n            if ((col &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (col &lt; 3)) {\n                if (board[row][col] == '-') {\n                    board[row][col] = currentPlayer;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(<http://System.in|System.in>);\n        TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();\n        game.initializeBoard();\n        do {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            int row;\n            int col;\n            do {\n                System.out.println(\"Player \" + game.currentPlayer + \", enter an empty row and column to place your mark!\");\n                row = scan.nextInt()-1;\n                col = scan.nextInt()-1;\n            }\n            while (!game.placeMark(row, col));\n            game.changePlayer();\n        }\n        while(!game.checkForWin() &amp;&amp; !game.isBoardFull());\n        if (game.isBoardFull() &amp;&amp; !game.checkForWin()) {\n            System.out.println(\"The game was a tie!\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            game.changePlayer();\n\nIsabelle (Developer):             System.out.println(Character.toUpperCase(game.currentPlayer) + \" Wins!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n&lt;/File&gt;\n\nPeter (CEO): Great work, Isabelle.

        "query": "<Chat History>\nThe following is the chat history on Slack:\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello team, this is Boshen, your Product Manager. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Once we receive approval from the CEO, I'll be sharing the PRD for review. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification on anything. Let's create some amazing products together!\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello everyone, I'm Isabelle, your developer for this project. I'll be writing the code once we have the approved PRD. Looking forward to working with you all!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter. I appreciate your readiness, Boshen. I'll be reviewing the project details shortly and will provide the necessary approvals. Let's ensure we have a clear understanding of the client's requirements before we proceed. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions you may have. Let's aim for a well-documented and efficient codebase. Looking forward to our collaboration.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi everyone!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we're on the same page, I have a few clarifying questions. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, should the players be able to choose their own symbols or will they always be 'X' and 'O'? Also, when you mention 'interactive', do you mean the game should be playable in the console or should it have a graphical user interface? Lastly, should the game support a single player mode against an AI? Your answers will help us shape the PRD accurately. Thanks!\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello team, and hi Benjamin. Thanks for sharing the requirements. I have a few clarifications to make sure I understand everything correctly. For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, when you mention handling unexpected inputs, do you want the game to simply display an error message and ask for a new input, or do you want it to provide suggestions for valid inputs? Also, should the players' names be displayed during the game? Lastly, for the game restart, should it be automatic or only upon players' request? Looking forward to your responses.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Always X and O. It should be playable in console. No AI needed.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Thank you for the clarifications, Benjamin. I will now start working on the PRD based on these requirements. Once the PRD is ready, I'll share it with the team for review. We'll ensure to create an engaging and user-friendly text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's create something great together!\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File: PRD_TicTacToeGame.docx&gt;\n\n1. Introduction\n   - Product Name: Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n   - Purpose: To create an interactive, console-based game that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe.\n   - Programming Language: Java\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   - The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   - Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   - Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   - The input will be validated to ensure it is a valid move (i.e., the specified position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied).\n\n4. Game Progress\n   - After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed.\n   - The game will check for a win or a tie after each move.\n   - If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   - If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message will be displayed and the player will be prompted to input a new move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   - After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again.\n   - If they choose to play again, the board will be reset and a new game will start.\n   - If they choose not to play again, the game will bid farewell and end.\n\n7. Additional Requirements\n   - The game will be playable in the console.\n   - No AI is needed; the game will be strictly two-player.\n   - The players' symbols will always be 'X' and 'O'.\n\n8. Conclusion\n   - The goal is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and efficient text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that adheres to the client's requirements and provides a smooth gaming experience.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer; \n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"\\n-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the board is full.\n    boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    // Check for a win.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.\n    private boolean checkDiagonalsForWin() {\n        return ((checkRowCol(board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) == true) || checkRowCol(board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]) == true);\n    }\n\n    // Check to see if all three values are the same and not empty.\n    private boolean checkRowCol(char c1, char c2, char c3) {\n        return ((c1 != '-') &amp;&amp; (c1 == c2) &amp;&amp; (c2 == c3));\n    }\n\n    // Change player marks back and forth.\n    public void changePlayer() {\n        if (currentPlayer == 'X') {\n            currentPlayer = 'O';\n        } else {\n            currentPlayer = 'X';\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Places a mark at the cell specified by row and col with the mark of the current player.\n    public boolean placeMark(int row, int col) {\n        if ((row &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (row &lt; 3)) {\n            if ((col &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (col &lt; 3)) {\n                if (board[row][col] == '-') {\n                    board[row][col] = currentPlayer;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(<http://System.in|System.in>);\n        TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();\n        game.initializeBoard();\n        do {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            int row;\n            int col;\n            do {\n                System.out.println(\"Player \" + game.currentPlayer + \", enter an empty row and column to place your mark!\");\n                row = scan.nextInt()-1;\n                col = scan.nextInt()-1;\n            }\n            while (!game.placeMark(row, col));\n            game.changePlayer();\n        }\n        while(!game.checkForWin() &amp;&amp; !game.isBoardFull());\n        if (game.isBoardFull() &amp;&amp; !game.checkForWin()) {\n            System.out.println(\"The game was a tie!\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Current board layout:\");\n            game.printBoard();\n            game.changePlayer();\n\nIsabelle (Developer):             System.out.println(Character.toUpperCase(game.currentPlayer) + \" Wins!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n&lt;/File&gt;\n\nPeter (CEO): Great work, Isabelle.
