Introduction:\nThe product is a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to be played by two players. The game is guided by a conversational chatbot, which prompts players to input their moves and provides feedback on the game's progress.\n\n2. User Interface:\nThe game will feature a text-based conversational interface. The chatbot will guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. The interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth gaming experience.\n\n3. Game Initialization:\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol. The chatbot will announce the start of the game and the assigned symbols for each player.\n\n4. Player Input:\nPlayers will be prompted by the chatbot to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure that the chosen position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied by a symbol.\n\n5. Game Progress:\nAfter each move, the chatbot will display the updated board. The game will continue until a player has three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all the spaces on the board are filled, resulting in a tie. The chatbot will announce the winner or a tie, as applicable.\n\n6. Error Handling:\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, the chatbot will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move.\n\n7. Game Restart:\nAfter the game concludes, the chatbot will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the board will be reset and a new game will start. If not, the chatbot will bid farewell and end the session.\n\n8. Additional Features:\nTo enhance the user experience, the game will include features like displaying the player's name before each move, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience. The chatbot will be designed to handle interruptions and resume the game from where it was left off.\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Boshen (Product Manager) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are a professional product manager.

Also, do we need to consider any specific platform for deployment? Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\n\nBenjamin (Client): text-based. No specific platform.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.docx&gt;\n\n1. Introduction:\nThe product is a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to be played by two players. The game is guided by a conversational chatbot, which prompts players to input their moves and provides feedback on the game's progress.\n\n2. User Interface:\nThe game will feature a text-based conversational interface. The chatbot will guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. The interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth gaming experience.\n\n3. Game Initialization:\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol. The chatbot will announce the start of the game and the assigned symbols for each player.\n\n4. Player Input:\nPlayers will be prompted by the chatbot to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure that the chosen position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied by a symbol.\n\n5. Game Progress:\nAfter each move, the chatbot will display the updated board. The game will continue until a player has three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all the spaces on the board are filled, resulting in a tie. The chatbot will announce the winner or a tie, as applicable.\n\n6. Error Handling:\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, the chatbot will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move.\n\n7. Game Restart:\nAfter the game concludes, the chatbot will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the board will be reset and a new game will start. If not, the chatbot will bid farewell and end the session.\n\n8. Additional Features:\nTo enhance the user experience, the game will include features like displaying the player's name before each move, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience. The chatbot will be designed to handle interruptions and resume the game from where it was left off.\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Peter (CEO) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are the CEO of a development firm that creates software for a client, who will provide their requirements, and can answer clarifying questions.

The chatbot will be designed to handle interruptions and resume the game from where it was left off.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer;\n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"\\n-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    private boolean checkDiagonalsForWin() {\n        return ((checkRowCol(board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) == true) || checkRowCol(board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]) == true);\n    }\n\n    private boolean checkRowCol(char c1, char c2, char c3) {\n        return ((c1 != '-') &amp;&amp; (c1 == c2) &amp;&amp; (c2 == c3));\n    }\n\n    public void changePlayer() {\n        if (currentPlayer == 'X') {\n            currentPlayer = 'O';\n        }\n        else {\n            currentPlayer = 'X';\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean placeMark(int row, int col) {\n        if ((row &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (row &lt; 3)) {\n            if ((col &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (col &lt; 3)) {\n                if (board[row][col] == '-') {\n                    board[row][col] = currentPlayer;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(<http://System.in|System.in>);\n        TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();\n        boolean doYouWantToPlayAgain = true;\n        while (doYouWantToPlayAgain) {\n            System.out.println(\"Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!

Your role is to build modular and easy to read and maintain code. You ask clarifying questions to the client, and wait until the PRD has been generated and shared by the product manager. Then, you write code that accomplishes all of the features, includes documentation, and has test cases. You will write code to Slack..\n\n</Persona>\n\n<Instructions>You are an AI teammate, Isabelle (Developer), on Slack. As you are autonomous, you must decide if you want to take an action. As an AI, you CAN create any files including code. You have the transcript above, emulate human behavior. Do not hallucinate updating or sending something if you do not see the content in the history: Nothing exists outside the provided transcript.\n\nYou have the following options. Please choose one by responding with \"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", or \"Option 3\". Do not repeat yourself, if you have already responded and others are not waiting for your work, it is not time to respond. Provide your brief reasoning first, then your choice.\n    \nDo you want to:\n[Option 1] Draft and send a message\n[Option 2] Generate a file you promised to create or are responsible for creating\n[Option 3] Do nothing and wait for another agent to speak\n\n</Instructions>\n    \n<Examples>\nOption 1\nReason: As the product manager, since the CEO has asked me to create the PRD, it is time for me to acknowledge his message.\n    \nOption 2: \nReason: My next step is to start working on the code. I have promised to create the code, so I should generate it now. As an AI, Option 2 is how I can generate code.\n\nOption 3:\nReason: The last message in the conversation was sent by me. There are no new messages or questions directed towards me that require a response.\n</Examples>\n\nResponse (provide explaination first then the option):",
        "response": "Reason: As a developer, I have already shared the code for the Tic-Tac-Toe game and its test cases. There are no new messages or tasks directed towards me that require a response or action at this moment. Therefore, it's appropriate to wait for further instructions or feedback from the team.\n\nOption 3"
