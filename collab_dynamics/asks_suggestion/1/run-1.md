# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for suggestion: direction, possible ways of action.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, I'm Boshen, your Product Manager. I'm here to ensure we design a product that's efficient and user-friendly. I'll be creating a comprehensive PRD once we have project approval from the CEO. Looking forward to our collaboration. Any suggestions or thoughts for our upcoming projects are always welcome.

Hi Boshen!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello team, and welcome Boshen. Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. Boshen, could you please clarify with Benjamin if there are any specific requirements for the conversational interface? For example, should it be text-based or voice-based? Also, do we need to consider any specific platform for deployment? Once we have these details, we can proceed with the PRD. Let's ensure we create a product that's both efficient and user-friendly.

Hi Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we design the product to your satisfaction, could you please clarify if the conversational interface should be text-based or voice-based? Also, do we need to consider any specific platform for deployment? Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

text-based. No specific platform.

1. Introduction:
The product is a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to be played by two players. The game is guided by a conversational chatbot, which prompts players to input their moves and provides feedback on the game's progress.
2. User Interface:
The game will feature a text-based conversational interface. The chatbot will guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. The interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth gaming experience.
3. Game Initialization:
The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol. The chatbot will announce the start of the game and the assigned symbols for each player.
4. Player Input:
Players will be prompted by the chatbot to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure that the chosen position is within the 3x3 grid and is not already occupied by a symbol.
5. Game Progress:
After each move, the chatbot will display the updated board. The game will continue until a player has three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all the spaces on the board are filled, resulting in a tie. The chatbot will announce the winner or a tie, as applicable.
6. Error Handling:
The game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, the chatbot will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move.
7. Game Restart:
After the game concludes, the chatbot will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the board will be reset and a new game will start. If not, the chatbot will bid farewell and end the session.
8. Additional Features:
To enhance the user experience, the game will include features like displaying the player's name before each move, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience. The chatbot will be designed to handle interruptions and resume the game from where it was left off.
