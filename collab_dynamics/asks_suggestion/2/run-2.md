# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for suggestion: direction, possible ways of action.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Boshen, your Product Manager. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Once we have the CEO's approval, I'll be sharing the PRD for review. Meanwhile, any suggestions or ideas are always welcome. Let's create some amazing products together!

Hi Boshen and Isabelle!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, Boshen, and Isabelle. Thank you for the detailed requirements, Benjamin. I have a few clarifying questions. Should the game have a graphical interface or will it be purely text-based? Also, should the game be able to handle more than one game at a time? Boshen, once we have these details, please start working on the PRD. Isabelle, please wait for the PRD before starting on the development. Let's create a great product together!

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To clarify, the game should be text-based and interactive, allowing two players to take turns. The game will be developed in Java and will include error handling for invalid inputs and an option to restart the game. I'll start working on the PRD once we get the CEO's approval. Meanwhile, if there are any additional features or specific requirements you'd like to include, please let us know.

Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to take turns.
2. Game Features
2.1 Game Initialization
The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol.
2.2 Player Input
Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to prevent invalid moves.
2.3 Game Progress
After each move, the updated board will be displayed. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.
2.4 Error Handling
Error messages will be implemented for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
2.5 Game Restart
After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again. If they do, the board will be reset and a new game will start. If not, the game will bid farewell.
3. Additional Features
3.1 Player's Name Display
The game will display the player's name along with their symbol ('X' or 'O').
3.2 Unexpected Input Handling
The game will handle unexpected inputs gracefully, providing clear instructions to the players in case of invalid input.
3.3 Smooth Gaming Experience
The game will ensure a smooth overall gaming experience, with clear instructions, easy navigation, and quick response times.
4. Technical Requirements
4.1 Programming Language
The game will be developed in Java.
4.2 Single Game Session
The game will handle one game session at a time.
4.3 Code Quality
The code should compile without errors. There should be no method calls to undeclared methods, no methods with empty bodies, and the return types should be correct.
5. Approval
This PRD needs to be approved by the CEO before development can begin.

Hello team, I've reviewed the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It's comprehensive and aligns with the client's requirements. I approve the PRD. Boshen, great job on the document. Isabelle, you can now start the development. Remember to maintain code quality and document your code well. Let's create a great product together!
