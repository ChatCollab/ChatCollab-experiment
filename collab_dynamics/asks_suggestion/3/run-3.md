In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for suggestion: direction, possible ways of action.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hi Boshen and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we meet your expectations, could you please clarify if there are any specific requirements for the conversational interface? For example, is there a specific language or any particular phrases you'd like the chatbot to use? Also, Boshen will be creating the PRD once we have your confirmation. Looking forward to your response.

Hi Benjamin, Boshen, and Peter! Benjamin, your idea for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game sounds engaging. I have a few clarifying questions to ensure I understand your requirements correctly.
1. For the player input, are we considering a specific format? For instance, should they input their move as 'row, column' or 'column, row'?
2. In case of an invalid move, should the game prompt the same player to try again, or should the turn pass to the other player?
3. When you mention 'displaying the player's name', do you mean the players should be able to input their names at the start of the game, or should we use default names?
Once we have these details, Boshen can incorporate them into the PRD. Looking forward to your feedback!

No additional requirements. Any format works as long as it is intuitive.

<Product Requirements Document>
1. Overview:
The product is a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is interactive and allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game displays the current state of the board after each move and indicates the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
2. Objectives:
- To provide an engaging and interactive gaming experience.
- To ensure smooth gameplay with clear instructions and feedback.
- To handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate responses.
3. Features:
- Game Initialization: The game starts by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
- Player Input: Players are prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
- Game Progress: The game displays the updated board after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game announces the result and ends.
- Error Handling: The game provides error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
- Game Restart: After the game concludes, the game asks if the players want to play again. If they do, the game resets the board and starts a new game. If not, the game bids farewell.
4. User Interface:
The game interacts with the players through a conversational interface. It prompts players to input their moves, provides feedback on the game's progress, and handles errors in a user-friendly manner. The interface is intuitive and easy to use.
5. Technical Requirements:
The game should be coded in the Java programming language. The code should compile without errors. The game should not call a method that is not declared, there should be no method with an empty body, and the return types should be correct.
6. Constraints:
The game is text-based and requires players to input their moves in a specific format. The game should be coded in Java and the code should compile without errors.
7. Future Enhancements:
Potential improvements could include adding a score tracker, allowing players to choose their symbols, and introducing different difficulty levels.

Thank you, Boshen, for the comprehensive PRD. Isabelle, before you start coding, do you have any questions or need further clarification on the PRD? Also, do you have any suggestions on how we can make the development process smoother or more efficient?

Isabelle (Developer)

Hello Peter, thank you for checking in. The PRD is clear and I don't have any questions at the moment. As for making the development process smoother, I suggest we could consider using a version control system like Git if we aren't already. This would allow us to track changes, work on different features simultaneously, and avoid conflicts. Let me know your thoughts on this.

Boshen (Product Manager)

Hi Isabelle, your suggestion about using a version control system like Git is excellent. It will indeed make our development process smoother and more efficient. I'll discuss this with Peter and get back to you. Meanwhile, if you have any other suggestions or questions, feel free to share.
