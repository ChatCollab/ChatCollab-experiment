In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for suggestion: direction, possible ways of action.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
