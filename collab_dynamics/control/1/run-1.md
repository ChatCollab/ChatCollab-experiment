Hi Boshen, Isabelle, and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, welcome to the team! If you have any specific requirements or clarifications for the project, feel free to share. We're here to ensure the product meets your expectations.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we're on the same page, I have a few clarifying questions: 1) Should the game be able to handle multiple games simultaneously? 2) Is there a specific user interface you have in mind for the game? 3) Should the game have a single-player mode against an AI? Boshen, once we have these answers, please start on the PRD. Isabelle, please wait for the PRD before starting development. Let's keep our communication open and efficient.

Title: Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
1. Introduction:
   - Product Name: Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
   - Purpose: To develop an interactive, text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java that allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid.
2. Product Overview:
   - The game will be played via a command line interface.
   - The game will not support multiple games simultaneously or a single-player mode against an AI.
3. Game Initialization:
   - The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.
   - The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol.
4. Player Input:
   - Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.
   - The input will be validated to prevent invalid moves such as placing a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
5. Game Progress:
   - After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed.
   - The game will announce the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
6. Error Handling:
   - The game will implement error messages for invalid inputs.
   - The game will handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
7. Game Restart:
   - After the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again.
   - If the players want to play again, the game will reset the board and start a new game.
   - If not, the game will bid farewell.
8. Non-Functional Requirements:
   - The game should be developed in Java.
   - The code should compile without errors.
   - The game should provide a smooth overall gaming experience.
9. Future Enhancements:
   - While not part of the initial requirements, future enhancements may include a single-player mode against an AI and support for multiple games simultaneously.
10. Approval:
    - This PRD is approved by: [Name of the Approver]
    - Date of Approval: [Date]
