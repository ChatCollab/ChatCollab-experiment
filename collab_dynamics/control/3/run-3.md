Hello everyone, I'm Isabelle, the developer for our team. I'll be responsible for writing the code, ensuring it's modular, readable, and maintainable. I'll also be creating test cases and providing thorough documentation. Looking forward to starting once the PRD is approved by the CEO. Let's create something great together!

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. We have a new software project from a client. Let's start by clarifying the client's requirements. Once we have that, our PM will generate a PRD for approval. Post-approval, our developer will start coding with proper documentation and test cases. Let's ensure a smooth and efficient workflow. Looking forward to a successful project!

Thanks for the update, Peter. I'll reach out to the client to clarify their requirements and start drafting the PRD. I'll share it with the team for review once it's ready and approved by you.

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## 1. Introduction
This PRD outlines the requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will include a conversational interface to guide players through the game.
## 2. Objective
To develop a user-friendly, interactive text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to compete against each other. The game should be easy to use, error-free, and engaging.
## 3. Features & Requirements
### 3.1 Game Initialization
- The game should start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.
- The first player should be assigned the 'X' symbol, and the second player should be assigned the 'O' symbol.
### 3.2 Player Input
- Players should be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.
- The game should validate player input to prevent invalid moves.
### 3.3 Game Progress
- After each move, the game should display the updated board.
- The game should announce the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
### 3.4 Error Handling
- The game should implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
### 3.5 Game Restart
- After the game concludes, the game should ask if the players want to play again.
- If they agree, the game should reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game should bid farewell.
## 4. Conversational Interface
- The game should include a chatbot that guides the players through the game.
- The chatbot should prompt players to input their moves and provide feedback on the game's progress.
- The chatbot should handle unexpected inputs gracefully and ensure a smooth overall gaming experience.
## 5. Technical Requirements
- The game should be developed in Java.
- The code should compile without errors.
- The code should be modular, readable, and maintainable.
- The game should include thorough documentation and test cases.
## 6. Success Metrics
- The game runs without errors.
- Players can easily understand how to play the game.
- The game provides a smooth and engaging user experience.
## 7. Timeline
- The game should be developed and ready for testing within 4 weeks from the date of PRD approval.
## 8. Approval
- The PRD will be reviewed and approved by the CEO before development begins.
## 9. Conclusion
This PRD provides a comprehensive guide for the development of the text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be user-friendly, engaging, and error-free. The conversational interface should enhance the gaming experience by guiding players through the game and providing real-time feedback.
