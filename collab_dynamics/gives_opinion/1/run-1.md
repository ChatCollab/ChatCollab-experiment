# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Gives opinion: evaluation, analysis, expresses feeling, wish.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm glad to be working with all of you. Let's ensure we follow our process: we'll first clarify any questions with the client, then Boshen will create a PRD, and finally, our developers will generate the code. Remember, all code should have strong documentation. Looking forward to a successful project!

Hi Boshen and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hi Benjamin, great to have you on board. If you have any specific product-related questions or details to share, feel free to let us know. Looking forward to working together!

Thanks for the detailed requirements, Benjamin. Before we proceed, I have a few clarifying questions: 1) Should the game have a graphical interface or is a console-based interface acceptable? 2) How should we handle cases where a player attempts to make a move out of turn? 3) Should the game support a single player mode against an AI? Once we have these details, Boshen will create a comprehensive PRD. Looking forward to your response.

Console is ok. Players should not be able to make a move out of turn. no AI is needed.

Thanks for the clarifications, Benjamin. Boshen, please proceed with creating a comprehensive PRD for a console-based, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's ensure we incorporate error handling for out-of-turn moves and invalid inputs. Looking forward to reviewing the PRD soon.

<Product Requirements Document>
File Name: PRD_TicTacToeGame.docx
1. Introduction
   - Product Name: Console-based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
   - Purpose: To develop an interactive, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java.
2. Game Initialization
   - The game starts by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.
   - Player 1 is assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 is assigned the 'O' symbol.
3. Player Input
   - Players are prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.
   - The input should be validated to prevent invalid moves.
4. Game Progress
   - After each move, the current state of the board is displayed.
   - The game concludes when a player wins or when there is a tie. The result is announced and the game ends.
5. Error Handling
   - Error messages are displayed for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
6. Game Restart
   - After the game concludes, players are asked if they want to play again.
   - If they agree, the board is reset and a new game starts.
   - If they decline, the game bids farewell and ends.
7. Error Handling for Out-of-Turn Moves
   - Error messages are displayed when a player attempts to make a move out of turn.
8. Technical Requirements
   - The game should be developed in Java.
   - The code should compile without errors.
   - The code should be well-documented.
9. Conclusion
   - This document provides a comprehensive set of requirements for the development of a console-based, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive, error-free, and user-friendly.
