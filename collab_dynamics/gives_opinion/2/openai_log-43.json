The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed description of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I have a few clarifying questions. Would you like the game to have a graphical interface or is a text-based interface sufficient? Also, do you have any specific requirements for the error messages?

In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed description of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I have a few clarifying questions. Would you like the game to have a graphical interface or is a text-based interface sufficient? Also, do you have any specific requirements for the error messages? Lastly, should the game support multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's wins?

I'm here to ensure we design a product that's efficient and user-friendly. I'll be creating the PRD once we have the CEO's approval. Looking forward to collaborating with you all.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Let's ensure we maintain clear communication, follow our established workflow, and prioritize strong documentation in our code. Your thoughts and ideas are always welcome. Let's create some amazing software together!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi Boshen and Peter!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed description of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I have a few clarifying questions. Would you like the game to have a graphical interface or is a text-based interface sufficient? Also, do you have any specific requirements for the error messages? Lastly, should the game support multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's wins? Your answers will help us design a product that meets your expectations.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Text-based is sufficient. No additional requirements. It can support multiple but that is optional.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game will be coded in Java.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol, and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n## 3. Player Input\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to prevent invalid moves. The game will not accept inputs that attempt to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enter an out-of-range position.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, the game will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If they decline, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Optional Feature: Multiple Rounds\nThe game may support multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's wins. This feature is optional and can be implemented based on the client's preference.\n\n## 8. Conclusion\nThis PRD provides a comprehensive guide for the development of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be user-friendly, efficient, and interactive, providing a smooth gaming experience for the players.\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Isabelle (Developer) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are a professional developer.

I'm here to ensure we design a product that's efficient and user-friendly. I'll be creating the PRD once we have the CEO's approval. Looking forward to collaborating with you all.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Let's ensure we maintain clear communication, follow our established workflow, and prioritize strong documentation in our code. Your thoughts and ideas are always welcome. Let's create some amazing software together!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi Boshen and Peter!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed description of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I have a few clarifying questions. Would you like the game to have a graphical interface or is a text-based interface sufficient? Also, do you have any specific requirements for the error messages? Lastly, should the game support multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's wins? Your answers will help us design a product that meets your expectations.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Text-based is sufficient. No additional requirements. It can support multiple but that is optional.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game will be coded in Java.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol, and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n## 3. Player Input\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to prevent invalid moves. The game will not accept inputs that attempt to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enter an out-of-range position.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, the game will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If they decline, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Optional Feature: Multiple Rounds\nThe game may support multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's wins. This feature is optional and can be implemented based on the client's preference.\n\n## 8. Conclusion\nThis PRD provides a comprehensive guide for the development of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be user-friendly, efficient, and interactive, providing a smooth gaming experience for the players.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer;\n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println();\n            System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the board is full.\n    boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    // Returns true if there is a win, false otherwise.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.

        "query": "<Chat History>\nThe following is the chat history on Slack:\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello team, I'm Boshen, your Product Manager. I'm here to ensure we design a product that's efficient and user-friendly. I'll be creating the PRD once we have the CEO's approval. Looking forward to collaborating with you all.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Let's ensure we maintain clear communication, follow our established workflow, and prioritize strong documentation in our code. Your thoughts and ideas are always welcome. Let's create some amazing software together!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi Boshen and Peter!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed description of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I have a few clarifying questions. Would you like the game to have a graphical interface or is a text-based interface sufficient? Also, do you have any specific requirements for the error messages? Lastly, should the game support multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's wins? Your answers will help us design a product that meets your expectations.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Text-based is sufficient. No additional requirements. It can support multiple but that is optional.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\nThis document outlines the product requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game will be coded in Java.\n\n## 2. Game Initialization\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol, and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol.\n\n## 3. Player Input\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to prevent invalid moves. The game will not accept inputs that attempt to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enter an out-of-range position.\n\n## 4. Game Progress\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, the game will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move.\n\n## 6. Game Restart\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If they decline, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 7. Optional Feature: Multiple Rounds\nThe game may support multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's wins. This feature is optional and can be implemented based on the client's preference.\n\n## 8. Conclusion\nThis PRD provides a comprehensive guide for the development of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be user-friendly, efficient, and interactive, providing a smooth gaming experience for the players.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer;\n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println();\n            System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the board is full.\n    boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    // Returns true if there is a win, false otherwise.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.
