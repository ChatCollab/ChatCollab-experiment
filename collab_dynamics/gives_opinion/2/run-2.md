In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Gives opinion: evaluation, analysis, expresses feeling, wish.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Let's ensure we maintain clear communication, follow our established workflow, and prioritize strong documentation in our code. Your thoughts and ideas are always welcome. Let's create some amazing software together!

Hi Boshen and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed description of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I have a few clarifying questions. Would you like the game to have a graphical interface or is a text-based interface sufficient? Also, do you have any specific requirements for the error messages? Lastly, should the game support multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's wins? Your answers will help us design a product that meets your expectations.

Text-based is sufficient. No additional requirements. It can support multiple but that is optional.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game will be coded in Java.
## 2. Game Initialization
The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol, and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol.
## 3. Player Input
Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to prevent invalid moves. The game will not accept inputs that attempt to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enter an out-of-range position.
## 4. Game Progress
After each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.
## 5. Error Handling
The game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, the game will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move.
## 6. Game Restart
After the game concludes, the game will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If they decline, the game will bid farewell.
## 7. Optional Feature: Multiple Rounds
The game may support multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's wins. This feature is optional and can be implemented based on the client's preference.
## 8. Conclusion
This PRD provides a comprehensive guide for the development of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be user-friendly, efficient, and interactive, providing a smooth gaming experience for the players.
