In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly.

I'm excited to see the innovative solutions we'll create together. Once I've reviewed and approved the project, Boshen will share the PRD. Let's prioritize clear communication and thorough documentation. Looking forward to our collaboration.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi Boshen, Isabelle, and Peter!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To clarify, the game will be text-based and interactive, with error handling and the option to restart. We'll ensure the code is well-documented and compiles correctly. We'll start working on the PRD once we receive approval from Peter. Looking forward to creating this engaging game together!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter.

The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly.

If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements.

Looking forward to our collaboration.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi Boshen, Isabelle, and Peter!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements.

I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Once we receive approval from the CEO, I'll be sharing a comprehensive PRD for review. Let's ensure we maintain strong documentation and effective communication throughout the process. Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns. Let's create some great products together!\n\nIsabelle (Developer): Hello everyone, I'm Isabelle, the developer for our team. I'm looking forward to building efficient and well-documented code for our projects. I'll be waiting for the PRD from the product manager and the approval from the CEO before I start. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarifications related to the development process.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm excited to see the innovative solutions we'll create together. Once I've reviewed and approved the project, Boshen will share the PRD. Let's prioritize clear communication and thorough documentation. Looking forward to our collaboration.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi Boshen, Isabelle, and Peter!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To clarify, the game will be text-based and interactive, with error handling and the option to restart. We'll ensure the code is well-documented and compiles correctly. We'll start working on the PRD once we receive approval from Peter. Looking forward to creating this engaging game together!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter. I've reviewed the client's requirements and they seem clear. Boshen, you have my approval to start working on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's ensure we cover all aspects including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Looking forward to seeing the PRD.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.docx&gt;\n\nTitle: Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Text-Based Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n1. Introduction\n   1.1 Purpose: To design and develop a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game will be guided by a conversational interface (chatbot) that prompts players to input their moves and provides feedback on the game's progress.\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   2.1 The game begins by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   2.2 Player 1 is assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 is assigned the 'O' symbol.\n   2.3 The chatbot will display the player's name along with their assigned symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   3.1 Players are prompted by the chatbot to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   3.2 The chatbot validates the input to prevent invalid moves.\n\n4. Game Progress\n   4.1 After each move, the chatbot displays the updated board.\n   4.2 The chatbot announces the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   5.1 The chatbot implements error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\n   5.2 The chatbot handles unexpected inputs gracefully, prompting the player to input a valid move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   6.1 After the game concludes, the chatbot asks if the players want to play again.\n   6.2 If they do, the chatbot resets the board and starts a new game. If not, the chatbot bids farewell.\n\n7. Code Requirements\n   7.1 The game should be coded in Java.\n   7.2 The code should compile correctly, with no method calls to undeclared methods, no methods with empty bodies, and correct return types.\n\n8. Documentation\n   8.1 The code should be well-documented, with clear comments explaining the functionality of each method and class.\n   8.2 The chatbot's prompts and responses should be clearly explained in the documentation.\n\n9. User Experience\n   9.1 The game should provide a smooth and engaging user experience.\n   9.2 The chatbot should guide the players through the game in a friendly and engaging manner.\n\n10. Testing\n    10.1 The game should be thoroughly tested to ensure it works as expected and handles all possible inputs correctly.\n\n11. Approval\n    11.1 The PRD will be submitted for review and approval by the CEO and the development team.\n\n\n\n(The above message was the last one sent in the Slack channel)</Chat History>\n\n<Persona>You are Peter (CEO) in the above conversation.\n\nYou are the CEO of a development firm that creates software for a client, who will provide their requirements, and can answer clarifying questions. Your role is to communicate with the team (developer and product manager) to coordinate building the product in this order: (1) Clarifying questions to client, (2) PM generates PRD, (3) Developer generates code..\n\n</Persona>\n\n<Instructions>You are an AI teammate, Peter (CEO), on Slack. As you are autonomous, you must decide if you want to take an action. As an AI, you CAN create any files including code. You have the transcript above, emulate human behavior. Do not hallucinate updating or sending something if you do not see the content in the history: Nothing exists outside the provided transcript.\n\nYou have the following options. Please choose one by responding with \"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", or \"Option 3\". Do not repeat yourself, if you have already responded and others are not waiting for your work, it is not time to respond. Provide your brief reasoning first, then your choice.\n    \nDo you want to:\n[Option 1] Draft and send a message\n[Option 2] Generate a file you promised to create or are responsible for creating\n[Option 3] Do nothing and wait for another agent to speak\n\n</Instructions>\n    \n<Examples>\nOption 1\nReason: As the product manager, since the CEO has asked me to create the PRD, it is time for me to acknowledge his message.\n    \nOption 2: \nReason: My next step is to start working on the code. I have promised to create the code, so I should generate it now. As an AI, Option 2 is how I can generate code.\n\nOption 3:\nReason: The last message in the conversation was sent by me. There are no new messages or questions directed towards me that require a response.\n</Examples>\n\nResponse (provide explaination first then the option):\n\nNote you should very likely wait for the following user that is typing on Slack: Isabelle (Developer)",
        "response": "Option 3\nReason: As the CEO, my role in this conversation was to provide approval for the project, which I have already done. The PRD has been shared by the product manager, Boshen. Now, it's time for the developer, Isabelle, to review the PRD and start working on the code. Therefore, there's no immediate action required from me at this point."

I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Once we receive approval from the CEO, I'll be sharing a comprehensive PRD for review. Let's ensure we maintain strong documentation and effective communication throughout the process. Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

I'm looking forward to building efficient and well-documented code for our projects. I'll be waiting for the PRD from the product manager and the approval from the CEO before I start. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarifications related to the development process.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm excited to see the innovative solutions we'll create together. Once I've reviewed and approved the project, Boshen will share the PRD. Let's prioritize clear communication and thorough documentation. Looking forward to our collaboration.\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi Boshen, Isabelle, and Peter!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To clarify, the game will be text-based and interactive, with error handling and the option to restart. We'll ensure the code is well-documented and compiles correctly. We'll start working on the PRD once we receive approval from Peter. Looking forward to creating this engaging game together!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter. I've reviewed the client's requirements and they seem clear. Boshen, you have my approval to start working on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's ensure we cover all aspects including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Looking forward to seeing the PRD.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.docx&gt;\n\nTitle: Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Text-Based Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n1. Introduction\n   1.1 Purpose: To design and develop a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game will be guided by a conversational interface (chatbot) that prompts players to input their moves and provides feedback on the game's progress.\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   2.1 The game begins by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   2.2 Player 1 is assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 is assigned the 'O' symbol.\n   2.3 The chatbot will display the player's name along with their assigned symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   3.1 Players are prompted by the chatbot to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   3.2 The chatbot validates the input to prevent invalid moves.\n\n4. Game Progress\n   4.1 After each move, the chatbot displays the updated board.\n   4.2 The chatbot announces the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   5.1 The chatbot implements error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\n   5.2 The chatbot handles unexpected inputs gracefully, prompting the player to input a valid move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   6.1 After the game concludes, the chatbot asks if the players want to play again.\n   6.2 If they do, the chatbot resets the board and starts a new game. If not, the chatbot bids farewell.\n\n7. Code Requirements\n   7.1 The game should be coded in Java.\n   7.2 The code should compile correctly, with no method calls to undeclared methods, no methods with empty bodies, and correct return types.\n\n8. Documentation\n   8.1 The code should be well-documented, with clear comments explaining the functionality of each method and class.\n   8.2 The chatbot's prompts and responses should be clearly explained in the documentation.\n\n9. User Experience\n   9.1 The game should provide a smooth and engaging user experience.\n   9.2 The chatbot should guide the players through the game in a friendly and engaging manner.\n\n10. Testing\n    10.1 The game should be thoroughly tested to ensure it works as expected and handles all possible inputs correctly.\n\n11. Approval\n    11.1 The PRD will be submitted for review and approval by the CEO and the development team.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer; \n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"\\n-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the board is full.\n    boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    // Check for a win.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.\n    private boolean checkDiagonalsForWin() {\n        return ((checkRowCol(board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) == true) || checkRowCol(board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]) == true);\n    }\n\n    // Check to see if all three values are the same (and not empty) indicating a win.\n    private boolean checkRowCol(char c1, char c2, char c3) {\n        return ((c1 != '-') &amp;&amp; (c1 == c2) &amp;&amp; (c2 == c3));\n    }\n\n    // Change player marks back and forth.\n    public void changePlayer() {\n        currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == 'X') ?

If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To clarify, the game will be text-based and interactive, with error handling and the option to restart. We'll ensure the code is well-documented and compiles correctly. We'll start working on the PRD once we receive approval from Peter. Looking forward to creating this engaging game together!\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello team, this is Peter. I've reviewed the client's requirements and they seem clear. Boshen, you have my approval to start working on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's ensure we cover all aspects including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Looking forward to seeing the PRD.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.docx&gt;\n\nTitle: Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Text-Based Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n1. Introduction\n   1.1 Purpose: To design and develop a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game will be guided by a conversational interface (chatbot) that prompts players to input their moves and provides feedback on the game's progress.\n\n2. Game Initialization\n   2.1 The game begins by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.\n   2.2 Player 1 is assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 is assigned the 'O' symbol.\n   2.3 The chatbot will display the player's name along with their assigned symbol.\n\n3. Player Input\n   3.1 Players are prompted by the chatbot to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.\n   3.2 The chatbot validates the input to prevent invalid moves.\n\n4. Game Progress\n   4.1 After each move, the chatbot displays the updated board.\n   4.2 The chatbot announces the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\n\n5. Error Handling\n   5.1 The chatbot implements error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\n   5.2 The chatbot handles unexpected inputs gracefully, prompting the player to input a valid move.\n\n6. Game Restart\n   6.1 After the game concludes, the chatbot asks if the players want to play again.\n   6.2 If they do, the chatbot resets the board and starts a new game. If not, the chatbot bids farewell.\n\n7. Code Requirements\n   7.1 The game should be coded in Java.\n   7.2 The code should compile correctly, with no method calls to undeclared methods, no methods with empty bodies, and correct return types.\n\n8. Documentation\n   8.1 The code should be well-documented, with clear comments explaining the functionality of each method and class.\n   8.2 The chatbot's prompts and responses should be clearly explained in the documentation.\n\n9. User Experience\n   9.1 The game should provide a smooth and engaging user experience.\n   9.2 The chatbot should guide the players through the game in a friendly and engaging manner.\n\n10. Testing\n    10.1 The game should be thoroughly tested to ensure it works as expected and handles all possible inputs correctly.\n\n11. Approval\n    11.1 The PRD will be submitted for review and approval by the CEO and the development team.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer; \n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println(\"\\n-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the board is full.\n    boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n\n    // Check for a win.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n\n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.\n    private boolean checkDiagonalsForWin() {\n        return ((checkRowCol(board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) == true) || checkRowCol(board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]) == true);\n    }\n\n    // Check to see if all three values are the same (and not empty) indicating a win.\n    private boolean checkRowCol(char c1, char c2, char c3) {\n        return ((c1 != '-') &amp;&amp; (c1 == c2) &amp;&amp; (c2 == c3));\n    }\n\n    // Change player marks back and forth.\n    public void changePlayer() {\n        currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == 'X') ?
