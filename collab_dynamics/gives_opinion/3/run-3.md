# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Gives opinion: evaluation, analysis, expresses feeling, wish.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Boshen, your Product Manager. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Once we receive approval from the CEO, I'll be sharing a comprehensive PRD for review. Let's ensure we maintain strong documentation and effective communication throughout the process. Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns. Let's create some great products together!

Hello everyone, I'm Isabelle, the developer for our team. I'm looking forward to building efficient and well-documented code for our projects. I'll be waiting for the PRD from the product manager and the approval from the CEO before I start. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarifications related to the development process.

Hi Boshen, Isabelle, and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To clarify, the game will be text-based and interactive, with error handling and the option to restart. We'll ensure the code is well-documented and compiles correctly. We'll start working on the PRD once we receive approval from Peter. Looking forward to creating this engaging game together!

Hello team, this is Peter. I've reviewed the client's requirements and they seem clear. Boshen, you have my approval to start working on the PRD for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's ensure we cover all aspects including game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. Looking forward to seeing the PRD.

Title: Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Text-Based Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game
1. Introduction
   1.1 Purpose: To design and develop a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game will be guided by a conversational interface (chatbot) that prompts players to input their moves and provides feedback on the game's progress.
2. Game Initialization
   2.1 The game begins by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.
   2.2 Player 1 is assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 is assigned the 'O' symbol.
   2.3 The chatbot will display the player's name along with their assigned symbol.
3. Player Input
   3.1 Players are prompted by the chatbot to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.
   3.2 The chatbot validates the input to prevent invalid moves.
4. Game Progress
   4.1 After each move, the chatbot displays the updated board.
   4.2 The chatbot announces the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
5. Error Handling
   5.1 The chatbot implements error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
   5.2 The chatbot handles unexpected inputs gracefully, prompting the player to input a valid move.
6. Game Restart
   6.1 After the game concludes, the chatbot asks if the players want to play again.
   6.2 If they do, the chatbot resets the board and starts a new game. If not, the chatbot bids farewell.
7. Code Requirements
   7.1 The game should be coded in Java.
   7.2 The code should compile correctly, with no method calls to undeclared methods, no methods with empty bodies, and correct return types.
8. Documentation
   8.1 The code should be well-documented, with clear comments explaining the functionality of each method and class.
   8.2 The chatbot's prompts and responses should be clearly explained in the documentation.
9. User Experience
   9.1 The game should provide a smooth and engaging user experience.
   9.2 The chatbot should guide the players through the game in a friendly and engaging manner.
10. Testing
    10.1 The game should be thoroughly tested to ensure it works as expected and handles all possible inputs correctly.
11. Approval
    11.1 The PRD will be submitted for review and approval by the CEO and the development team.
