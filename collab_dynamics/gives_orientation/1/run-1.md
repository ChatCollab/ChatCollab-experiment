In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Gives orientation: information, repeats, clarifies, confirms.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, I'm Isabelle, your developer. I'll be writing code, ensuring it's modular, easy to read, and maintain. I'll also be creating documentation and test cases. Looking forward to receiving the PRD and starting work once it's approved by the CEO.

Hello Team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming project. Let's ensure we have a clear understanding of the client's requirements before we proceed. The PM will then generate a PRD for approval. Once approved, the development team can begin coding. Remember, strong documentation is key. Let's get started!

Hi Isabelle and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello everyone, this is Boshen, your Product Manager. I'll be working on the PRD once we have a clear understanding of the client's requirements. Looking forward to collaborating with you all. Let's make this project a success!

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we're on the same page, I have a few clarifying questions. Should the game allow for player names to be input, or will they simply be referred to as 'Player X' and 'Player O'? Also, for the conversational interface, do you have a preference for the tone of the chatbot - should it be formal, casual, or something else? Lastly, regarding error handling, should the game simply display an error message, or would you like it to also guide the player towards making a valid move? Your answers will help us in creating a detailed PRD. Thank you.

They can be referred as Player X and O. No preferences besides those in the requirements.

1. Overview:
The product is a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game is coded in Java and each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game displays the current state of the board after each move and indicates the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
2. Objectives:
- To create an interactive, text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- To ensure the game is error-free and compiles successfully.
- To provide a conversational interface that guides the players through the game.
3. Features:
- Game Initialization: The game starts by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
- Player Input: Players are prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
- Game Progress: The game displays the updated board after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result is announced and the game ends.
- Error Handling: The game provides error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
- Game Restart: After the game concludes, the players are asked if they want to play again. If they do, the board is reset and a new game starts. If not, the game ends.
4. User Interface:
The game features a conversational interface that guides the players through the game. The chatbot prompts the players to input their moves and provides feedback on the game's progress. The interface is designed to be engaging and user-friendly.
5. Error Handling:
The game implements error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message is displayed. The error handling is designed to be clear and instructive, guiding the player towards making a valid move.
6. Future Enhancements:
Potential improvements for future versions of the game include the ability to customize player symbols, the addition of a score tracker, and the implementation of different difficulty levels.

Great work, Isabelle! The code and test cases for the Tic-Tac-Toe game look comprehensive. I appreciate your efforts in ensuring the code is well-documented and modular. Boshen, the PRD was detailed and clear. Thanks for your hard work. Let's proceed to the next steps of the project.
