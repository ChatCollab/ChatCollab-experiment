# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Gives orientation: information, repeats, clarifies, confirms.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Boshen, your Product Manager. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Once we have the CEO's approval, I'll be sharing a comprehensive PRD for review. Let's ensure we maintain strong documentation and clear communication throughout. Feel free to reach out with any questions or clarifications needed.

Hello team, I'm Isabelle, one of the developers. Looking forward to the PRD and starting on the project. I'll ensure the code is modular, well-documented, and includes test cases. Let's build something great together!

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. We have a new software development project from a client. Let's start by clarifying the client's requirements. Once we have that, our PM will generate a PRD for approval. Post-approval, our developer will start coding. Remember, strong documentation through inline comments is crucial. Let's get started!

Hi Boshen, Isabelle, and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To confirm, the game should be text-based, interactive, and developed in Java. It should validate player inputs, display the game board after each move, and announce the winner or a tie at the end. Additionally, it should handle errors gracefully and offer a restart option. We'll ensure a smooth and engaging gaming experience. Boshen, please start drafting the PRD based on these requirements. Isabelle, please wait for the PRD approval before starting the development. Let's create a great product together!

Title: Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Text-Based Tic-TacToe Game
1. Introduction
   The purpose of this document is to outline the product requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid.
2. Game Initialization
   The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol, and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol. The player's names will be displayed along with their respective symbols.
3. Player Input
   Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid and the chosen cell is not already occupied.
4. Game Progress
   After each move, the current state of the board will be displayed. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.
5. Error Handling
   The game will handle errors gracefully by displaying appropriate error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
6. Game Restart
   After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again. If they agree, the board will be reset and a new game will start. If not, the game will bid farewell.
7. Additional Features
   To enhance the user experience, the game will handle unexpected inputs gracefully and ensure a smooth overall gaming experience. The player's name will be displayed along with their symbol, and the game will provide feedback on the game's progress.
8. Conclusion
   This PRD outlines the requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be developed in Java and will provide an engaging and user-friendly gaming experience. The development team is expected to adhere to these requirements to ensure the product meets the client's expectations and provides a smooth gaming experience.
