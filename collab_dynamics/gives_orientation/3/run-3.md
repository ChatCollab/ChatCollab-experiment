# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Gives orientation: information, repeats, clarifies, confirms.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, I'm Boshen, your Product Manager. I'll be working closely with you all to design efficient and user-friendly products. I'll be creating comprehensive PRDs post CEO's approval and will be available to answer any product-related queries. Looking forward to our collaboration.

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. We have a new project on board. Let's start with clarifying questions to the client. Once we have all the details, our PM will generate a PRD. After my approval, our developer will start coding. Remember, strong documentation is key. Let's get started!

Hi Boshen and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To ensure we're on the same page, I have a few clarifying questions. Firstly, for the conversational interface, do you have any specific design or style in mind? Secondly, should the game support any specific platform or should it be platform-independent? Lastly, do you have any specific timeline for this project? Your answers will help us create a comprehensive PRD and deliver a product that meets your expectations.

Hello Benjamin! Thank you for the detailed description of the project. To clarify, do you have any specific requirements for the chatbot's language or platform? Also, do you want the game to have a single-player mode against an AI, or strictly a two-player mode? Your answers will help us create a more precise PRD. Looking forward to your response.

No requirements for the chatbot language or platform.
10:20
Only two player mode.

Title: Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game will be coded in Java and will include a conversational interface to guide the players.
1.2 Scope
This PRD covers the requirements for game initialization, player input, game progress, error handling, and game restart. It also includes additional features to enhance the user experience.
2. Game Initialization
2.1 The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 board.
2.2 The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player the 'O' symbol.
3. Player Input
3.1 The game will prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol.
3.2 The game will validate the input to prevent invalid moves.
4. Game Progress
4.1 After each move, the game will display the updated board.
4.2 The game will announce the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
5. Error Handling
5.1 The game will implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
6. Game Restart
6.1 After the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again.
6.2 If they do, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.
7. Additional Features
7.1 The game will display the player's name.
7.2 The game will handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
7.3 The game will ensure a smooth overall gaming experience.
8. Non-Functional Requirements
8.1 The game should be coded in Java.
8.2 The game should be platform-independent.
9. Constraints
9.1 The game will not include a single-player mode against an AI.
10. Approval
The PRD will be approved by the CEO and the client before the development process begins.
