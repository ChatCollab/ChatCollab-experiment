In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for Suggestion: direction, possible ways of action.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Boshen, your Product Manager. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. As we kick off, I'd love to hear any initial thoughts or suggestions you might have for our product development process. Let's create something amazing together!

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm looking forward to working with you all on this project. Could we start by having the client share their requirements? Then, we can discuss potential ways to approach this project. Thanks!

Hi Boshen and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hi Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. To clarify, the game will be text-based and interactive, with the chatbot guiding the players. The players will input their moves by specifying the row and column, and the game will validate these inputs. The game will display the updated board after each move, announce the result, and offer a restart option. We will also implement error handling for invalid inputs. Does this cover all your requirements? Do you have any specific suggestions for the conversational interface or any additional features you'd like us to consider?

Hello Benjamin, Boshen, and Peter! Thanks for the detailed requirements, Benjamin. I have a few clarifying questions to ensure I understand the project fully. Firstly, for the conversational interface, do you have a preference for how the players should input their moves? For example, should they type 'row 1, column 2' or would a simpler input like '1,2' suffice? Secondly, regarding handling unexpected inputs, should the game prompt the user to re-enter their move, or would you prefer a different approach? Your feedback will help me develop a user-friendly and engaging game. Thanks!

Thanks for your questions, Isabelle. Benjamin, could you please provide your input on Isabelle's questions? Your feedback will help us ensure that we're developing a product that meets your expectations. Also, Boshen, once we have Benjamin's feedback, could you start drafting the PRD? Let's keep the momentum going, team!

Boshen (Product Manager)

Hi Isabelle, great questions. For move inputs, a simpler format like '1,2' should suffice, but we should guide the players initially about this format. For unexpected inputs, prompting the user to re-enter their move seems like a good approach. However, let's also ask Benjamin if he has any specific preferences. Benjamin, do you have any suggestions on these aspects?

# Product Requirement Document (PRD) - Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with a conversational interface. The game will be coded in Java and will allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid.
## 2. Objective
The main goal of this product is to create an engaging, user-friendly Tic-Tac-Toe game that guides players through the game, validates their inputs, provides feedback on the game's progress, and offers a restart option.
## 3. Requirements
The detailed requirements for the game are as follows:
- **Game Initialization**: The game should start by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
- **Player Input**: Players should input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The game should validate these inputs to prevent invalid moves.
- **Game Progress**: The game should display the updated board after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game should announce the result and end the game.
- **Error Handling**: The game should implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
- **Game Restart**: After the game concludes, the game should ask the players if they want to play again. If they do, the game should reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game should bid farewell.
## 4. User Interface
The game will have a conversational interface. Players will input their moves in a simple format like '1,2', where '1' represents the row and '2' represents the column. For unexpected inputs, the game will prompt the user to re-enter their move.
## 5. Error Handling
The game will handle errors by displaying appropriate messages for invalid inputs. For example, if a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space, the game will display a message like "This space is already occupied. Please choose another space." If a player enters an out-of-range position, the game will display a message like "Invalid position. Please enter a position within the 3x3 grid."
## 6. Game Restart
After the game concludes, the game will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If they decline, the game will display a farewell message and end.
## 7. Additional Features
To make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game could display the player's name before each move. The game could also handle unexpected inputs gracefully by prompting the user to re-enter their move and providing guidance on the correct input format.
