# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for Suggestion: direction, possible ways of action.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm looking forward to working together on our upcoming project. Could we start by discussing potential client requirements and suggestions for our initial approach?

Hi Boshen, Isabelle, Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. Just to clarify, do you want the chatbot to handle any specific scenarios, like if a player tries to make a move out of their turn? Also, should the chatbot provide any strategic suggestions to the players during the game? Boshen, once we have these details, could you please start drafting the PRD? Isabelle, your thoughts on the initial approach for coding this game would be appreciated.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. I'll start drafting the PRD based on these. Peter, I agree, it would be helpful to know if the chatbot should handle specific scenarios or provide strategic suggestions. Isabelle, once we have these details, I'd appreciate your thoughts on the initial approach for coding. Let's ensure we deliver a product that meets Benjamin's expectations and provides a smooth gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. I have a few clarifications to ensure I understand the project correctly. For the player input, should we allow any format or stick to a specific one like 'row,column'? Also, for the game restart, should the players switch their symbols or keep the same ones? Peter, once we have these details, I can start thinking about the best approach for coding this game. Boshen, your thoughts on these aspects for the PRD would be appreciated.

Hello Benjamin, Isabelle has raised some valid points. Could you please clarify if there's a specific format for player input and if players should switch their symbols for a game restart? Also, should the chatbot handle specific scenarios or provide strategic suggestions? Your feedback will help us create a comprehensive PRD. Peter, once we have these details, I'll start drafting the PRD. Isabelle, I appreciate your proactive approach and will incorporate your suggestions in the PRD.

No strategic suggestions, just the requirements I have provided.

For the game restart, they should be able to choose new ones.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be interactive, allowing two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game will be coded in Java and will include a conversational interface (chatbot) to guide the players through the game.
## 2. Game Initialization
The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The chatbot will assign 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player. The players' names will be displayed alongside their respective symbols for a personalized gaming experience.
## 3. Player Input
Players will be prompted by the chatbot to input their moves. They will specify the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to prevent invalid moves, such as placing a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
## 4. Game Progress
After each move, the chatbot will display the updated board. The game will continue until a player wins by having three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a tie when all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won. The chatbot will announce the result and end the game.
## 5. Error Handling
The game will handle errors gracefully. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, the chatbot will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move.
## 6. Game Restart
After the game concludes, the chatbot will ask the players if they want to play again. If they agree, the chatbot will reset the board and start a new game. The players will be given the option to choose new symbols. If the players do not want to play again, the chatbot will bid farewell.
## 7. Additional Features
To enhance the user experience, the game will include additional features such as displaying the player's name during their turn and handling unexpected inputs gracefully. The chatbot will provide clear instructions and feedback to ensure a smooth gaming experience.
This PRD provides a comprehensive guide for the development of the text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The aim is to create a user-friendly and engaging game that meets the client's requirements and provides a smooth gaming experience.
