# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Asks for Suggestion: direction, possible ways of action.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Boshen, your Product Manager. I'm looking forward to working with you all on our upcoming projects. Once we have the CEO's approval, I'll be sharing a comprehensive PRD for review. I encourage you to share any suggestions or questions you may have. Let's create great products together!

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm excited to see what we can achieve together on this project. Boshen, once you have the PRD ready, please share it with the team for review. I encourage everyone to share their suggestions and ask any clarifying questions. Let's ensure we have a well-documented and efficient code. Looking forward to your inputs.

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. Team, do we have any clarifying questions for Benjamin about the Tic-Tac-Toe game? Once we have all the information we need, Boshen, please start working on the PRD. Let's ensure we have a well-documented and efficient code for this project. Looking forward to your inputs.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. I have a few clarifying questions to ensure we fully understand the game's requirements. First, should the game support a single player mode against an AI? Second, should the game have a GUI or will it be entirely text-based? Lastly, should the game keep track of the score if players decide to play multiple rounds? Looking forward to your responses.

No AI. Text based. It can keep track across rounds.

# Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game will be coded in Java and will display the current state of the board after each move, indicating the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
## 2. Game Initialization
At the start of the game, an empty 3x3 grid will be displayed. Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol and Player 2 will be assigned the 'O' symbol. The players' names will be displayed along with their respective symbols.
## 3. Player Input
Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to prevent invalid moves such as placing a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
## 4. Game Progress
After each move, the updated board will be displayed. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the result will be announced and the game will end.
## 5. Error Handling
The game will implement error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space or enters an out-of-range position, an error message will be displayed and the player will be prompted to input a valid move.
## 6. Game Restart
After the game concludes, players will be asked if they want to play again. If they agree, the board will be reset and a new game will start. If not, the game will end with a farewell message.
## 7. Score Keeping
The game will keep track of the score across multiple rounds. The score will be displayed at the end of each game.
## 8. User Experience
The game will handle unexpected inputs gracefully and ensure a smooth overall gaming experience. The game will provide clear instructions and feedback to the players to guide them through the game.
## 9. Technical Requirements
The game will be coded in Java. The code will be well-documented and efficient, ensuring that it compiles without errors. The code will not call a method that is not declared, there will be no method with an empty body, and the return types will be correct.
## 10. Non-Functional Requirements
The game will not support a single player mode against an AI and will be entirely text-based. The game will be designed to be simple and user-friendly, providing an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience for the players.

Thank you, Boshen, for the comprehensive PRD. I appreciate the attention to detail, especially in the areas of error handling and user experience. Team, do you have any suggestions or feedback on the PRD before we proceed? Once we have everyone's input, we can move forward with the development phase.
