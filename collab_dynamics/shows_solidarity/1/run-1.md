# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Shows solidarity: raises other's status, gives help, reward.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, this is Peter, your CEO. I'm thrilled to have such a dedicated team. Boshen, once we have the client's requirements, you can start on the PRD. Isabelle, after the PRD is approved, you can begin development. Remember, thorough documentation is key. Let's create something amazing together!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Thank you for the detailed requirements, Benjamin. Boshen, please start working on the PRD for this text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Make sure to include all the aspects mentioned by the client, especially the conversational interface and error handling. Isabelle, please wait for the PRD before starting development. Let's create a user-friendly and efficient game!

File Name: PRD_TicTacToeGame.docx
1. Introduction
The product is a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game will be developed in Java and will include a conversational interface to guide the players through the game.
2. Game Initialization
The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player will be assigned the 'O' symbol. The game will prompt the players to input their names for a more personalized experience.
3. Player Input
Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The input will be validated to ensure it is within the range of the grid (1-3 for both row and column) and that the chosen position is not already occupied.
4. Game Progress
After each move, the game will display the updated board. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If a player wins, the game will announce the winner by displaying a message with the player's name and symbol. If the game ends in a tie, the game will announce a tie and end the game.
5. Error Handling
The game will handle error messages for invalid inputs. If a player attempts to place a symbol in an already occupied space, the game will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move. If a player enters an out-of-range position, the game will display an error message and prompt the player to input a valid move.
6. Game Restart
After the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they agree, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will display a farewell message and end the game session.
7. Additional Features
To make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly, the game will display the player's name during prompts and feedback messages. The game will handle unexpected inputs gracefully by displaying appropriate error messages and prompting for valid input. The game will ensure a smooth overall gaming experience by providing clear instructions and feedback.
8. Conclusion
This PRD provides a comprehensive guide for the development of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be user-friendly, efficient, and engaging, providing a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience for the players.

Great work, Isabelle! The code and tests for the Tic-Tac-Toe game look comprehensive and well-documented. Let's proceed to the next step. Please ensure that the code is compiled and tested thoroughly. Also, let's prepare for a code review session. Boshen, please coordinate with Isabelle for the same. Keep up the good work, team!
