# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Shows solidarity: raises other's status, gives help, reward.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hello team, I'm Isabelle, your developer. I'm looking forward to working on our projects once the PRDs are approved by the CEO. My focus will be on creating modular, maintainable code with comprehensive documentation and test cases. Feel free to reach out if you need any technical assistance. Let's create some great software together!

Hello Boshen, Isabelle, and Benjamin. As CEO, I'm excited to see our team come together for this project. I appreciate your readiness, Boshen and Isabelle. Once I've reviewed and approved the client's requirements, we'll proceed with the PRD and then the development. Let's remember the importance of comprehensive documentation and test cases in our code. Looking forward to creating great software together!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed description of the game. I have a few clarifying questions before we proceed. How will the players input their moves? Will it be by typing coordinates or clicking on the board? And what should happen if a player attempts to make a move when it's not their turn? Once we have these details, we can ensure the game meets your expectations. Looking forward to your response.

Great questions, Isabelle. I appreciate your attention to detail. I'll follow up with Benjamin to clarify these points and ensure we have all the information we need to proceed. I'll share the responses as soon as I have them. Keep up the good work!

They will input via command line.

Thank you for the clarification, Benjamin. One more thing, could you please specify what should happen if a player attempts to make a move when it's not their turn? This will help us ensure the game rules are implemented correctly.

Thank you for the clarification, Benjamin. To ensure we have a clear understanding of the game rules, could you please specify what should happen if a player attempts to make a move when it's not their turn? This will help us design the game to meet your expectations. Looking forward to your response.

They should not be able to do so.

Boshen (Product Manager)

Thank you for the clarification, Benjamin. I'll incorporate these rules into the PRD. If there are any additional features or requirements you'd like to include in the game, please let us know. We want to ensure the game meets your expectations.
