The interface will be designed to be engaging, user-friendly, and handle unexpected inputs gracefully.\n\n## 3. Game Initialization\nThe game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 board. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player the 'O' symbol.\n\n## 4. Player Input\nPlayers will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The game will validate the input to prevent invalid moves.\n\n## 5. Game Progress\nAfter each move, the game will display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.\n\n## 6. Error Handling\nThe game will implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\n\n## 7. Game Restart\nAfter the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they do, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.\n\n## 8. Additional Features\nThe game will consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\n## 9. Technical Requirements\nThe code should compile without errors. There should be no method calls to undeclared methods, no methods with empty bodies, and the return types should be correct.\n\n## 10. Conclusion\nThis PRD outlines the requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be engaging, user-friendly, and handle unexpected inputs gracefully. It will validate player inputs, display the game progress, handle errors, and offer a restart option. The game will be coded in Java and compile without errors. The expected outcome is a smooth, enjoyable gaming experience for the players."

The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. Just to clarify, do you want the chatbot to handle any specific error messages or unexpected inputs beyond the ones mentioned? Also, should the game support any specific commands like 'quit' or 'restart' during the game? Boshen, once we get these details, you can start working on the PRD.\n\nBenjamin (Client): No additional handling. Other commands are optional.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirement Document for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\nThe product is a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid.

Consider the following aspects in your response:\nGame Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.\nPlayer Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.\n\nPeter (CEO): Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. Just to clarify, do you want the chatbot to handle any specific error messages or unexpected inputs beyond the ones mentioned? Also, should the game support any specific commands like 'quit' or 'restart' during the game? Boshen, once we get these details, you can start working on the PRD.\n\nBenjamin (Client): No additional handling. Other commands are optional.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirement Document for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1. Introduction\nThe product is a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid.

I'll be coordinating our projects and approving PRDs and code. Let's create amazing products together. Boshen, looking forward to your efficient product designs!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Hi Boshen and Peter!\n\nBenjamin (Client): Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.\nYour task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.\nGame Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.\nError Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.\nGame Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.\nFeel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly.

Just to clarify, do you want the chatbot to handle any specific error messages or unexpected inputs beyond the ones mentioned? Also, should the game support any specific commands like 'quit' or 'restart' during the game? Boshen, once we get these details, you can start working on the PRD.\n\nBenjamin (Client): No additional handling. Other commands are optional.\n\nBoshen (Product Manager): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe_PRD.md&gt;\n\n# Product Requirement Document for Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n## 1.

The expected outcome is a smooth, enjoyable gaming experience for the players.\n\nIsabelle (Developer): &lt;File Name: TicTacToe.java&gt;\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TicTacToe {\n    private char[][] board; \n    private char currentPlayer; \n\n    public TicTacToe() {\n        board = new char[3][3];\n        currentPlayer = 'X';\n        initializeBoard();\n    }\n    \n    // Set/Reset the board back to all empty values.\n    public void initializeBoard() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                board[i][j] = '-';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Print the current board.\n    public void printBoard() {\n        System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            System.out.print(\"| \");\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                System.out.print(board[i][j] + \" | \");\n            }\n            System.out.println();\n            System.out.println(\"-------------\");\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Check if the board is full.\n    public boolean isBoardFull() {\n        boolean isFull = true;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n                if (board[i][j] == '-') {\n                    isFull = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return isFull;\n    }\n    \n    // Check for a win.\n    public boolean checkForWin() {\n        return (checkRowsForWin() || checkColumnsForWin() || checkDiagonalsForWin());\n    }\n    \n    // Loop through rows and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkRowsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[i][0], board[i][1], board[i][2]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    // Loop through columns and see if any are winners.\n    private boolean checkColumnsForWin() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n            if (checkRowCol(board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]) == true) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    // Check the two diagonals to see if either is a win.\n    private boolean checkDiagonalsForWin() {\n        return ((checkRowCol(board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) == true) || checkRowCol(board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]) == true);\n    }\n    \n    // Check to see if all three values are the same (and not empty) indicating a win.\n    private boolean checkRowCol(char c1, char c2, char c3) {\n        return ((c1 != '-') &amp;&amp; (c1 == c2) &amp;&amp; (c2 == c3));\n    }\n    \n    // Change player marks back and forth.\n    public void changePlayer() {\n        if (currentPlayer == 'X') {\n            currentPlayer = 'O';\n        }\n        else {\n            currentPlayer = 'X';\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Places a mark at the cell specified by row and col with the mark of the current player.\n    public boolean placeMark(int row, int col) {\n        if ((row &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (row &lt; 3)) {\n            if ((col &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (col &lt; 3)) {\n                if (board[row][col] == '-') {\n                    board[row][col] = currentPlayer;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(<http://System.in|System.in>);\n        TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();\n        boolean doYouWantToPlayAgain;\n        do {\n            System.out.println(\"Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
