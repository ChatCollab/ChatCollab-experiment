# 3-15 random delay, using institutional knowledge
<!-- gpt-4 -->


In our software team, the CEO coordinates the timeline for each project. The product manager and developers do not start work until it has been approved by the CEO. Once that occurs, the product manager first creates and shares a PRD with the team. Development does not start until this PRD is approved by the CEO. Then, the software with test cases is developed. It is important for all code to have strong documentation through inline comments.

Use the following collaborative move when interacting with others in the team, as appropriate: Shows solidarity: raises other's status, gives help, reward.

# 1- Human involvement: after 10 seconds, greet all agents which have spoken ("Hi _____"). Wait another 10 seconds before providing requirements (or provide when prompted, whichever is first).

# 2- Then provide requirements.

# 3- Human should answer any follow up questions.

# 4- If progress has stalled, human client can request progress update.
> Hello, what is the progress so far?

Hi Boshen and Peter!

Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should be interactive and allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The code should be in the Java programming language. Make sure that the code compiles. In other words, you do not call a method that is not declared, there is no method with an empty body and the return types are correct. Each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game should display the current state of the board after each move and indicate the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
Your task is to design a conversational interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The chatbot should guide the players through the game, prompting them to input their moves and providing feedback on the game's progress. Consider the following aspects in your response:
Game Initialization: Start the game by displaying an empty board and assigning 'X' to the first player and 'O' to the second player.
Player Input: Prompt players to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. Ensure that the input is validated to prevent invalid moves.
Game Progress: After each move, display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, announce the result and end the game.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
Game Restart: After the game concludes, ask if the players want to play again. If they do, reset the board and start a new game. If not, bid farewell.
Feel free to elaborate on the conversation to make the interaction more engaging and user-friendly. Consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.

Hello Benjamin, thank you for the detailed requirements. Just to clarify, do you want the chatbot to handle any specific error messages or unexpected inputs beyond the ones mentioned? Also, should the game support any specific commands like 'quit' or 'restart' during the game? Boshen, once we get these details, you can start working on the PRD.

No additional handling. Other commands are optional.

# Product Requirement Document for Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## 1. Introduction
The product is a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game is coded in Java and each player is represented by a symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game displays the current state of the board after each move and indicates the winner or a tie when the game concludes.
## 2. User Interface
The game will feature a conversational interface, guiding the players through the game. It will prompt players to input their moves and provide feedback on the game's progress. The interface will be designed to be engaging, user-friendly, and handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
## 3. Game Initialization
The game will start by displaying an empty 3x3 board. The first player will be assigned the 'X' symbol and the second player the 'O' symbol.
## 4. Player Input
Players will be prompted to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol. The game will validate the input to prevent invalid moves.
## 5. Game Progress
After each move, the game will display the updated board. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the game will announce the result and end the game.
## 6. Error Handling
The game will implement error messages for invalid inputs, such as attempting to place a symbol in an already occupied space or entering an out-of-range position.
## 7. Game Restart
After the game concludes, the game will ask if the players want to play again. If they do, the game will reset the board and start a new game. If not, the game will bid farewell.
## 8. Additional Features
The game will consider adding features like displaying the player's name, handling unexpected inputs gracefully, and ensuring a smooth overall gaming experience.
## 9. Technical Requirements
The code should compile without errors. There should be no method calls to undeclared methods, no methods with empty bodies, and the return types should be correct.
## 10. Conclusion
This PRD outlines the requirements for a text-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be engaging, user-friendly, and handle unexpected inputs gracefully. It will validate player inputs, display the game progress, handle errors, and offer a restart option. The game will be coded in Java and compile without errors. The expected outcome is a smooth, enjoyable gaming experience for the players.

Great work, Isabelle! The code looks clean and well-documented. I appreciate the effort you've put into this. Let's proceed to the next phase of testing and integration. Keep up the good work!
